hello

Based on your notes, the "lookup" tool can be used to perform a semantic search of your data. To use the tool, you will need to provide at least three hypothetical notes that are semantically similar to the notes necessary to fulfill your request. The hypothetical notes may contain paragraphs, lists, or checklists in markdown format. Hypothetical notes always begin with breadcrumbs containing the anticipated folder(s), file name, and relevant headings separated by ' > ' (no slashes). Example: PARENT FOLDER NAME > CHILD FOLDER NAME > FILE NAME > HEADING 1 > HEADING 2 > HEADING 3: HYPOTHETICAL NOTE CONTENTS.

The "lookup" tool can be particularly useful when you are unsure of the exact keywords or phrases to use in your search. By providing the tool with a set of hypothetical notes that are semantically similar to your desired results, you can increase the chances of finding relevant information in your data.

Here is an example of how you might use the "lookup" tool:

```
lookup(
    hypothetical_1="PARENT FOLDER NAME > CHILD FOLDER NAME > FILE NAME > HEADING 1 > HEADING 2 > HEADING 3: This is a hypothetical note that is semantically similar to the notes I am looking for.",
    hypothetical_2="PARENT FOLDER NAME > CHILD FOLDER NAME > FILE NAME > HEADING 1 > HEADING 2 > HEADING 3: This is another hypothetical note that is semantically similar to the notes I am looking for.",
    hypothetical_3="PARENT FOLDER NAME > CHILD FOLDER NAME > FILE NAME > HEADING 1 > HEADING 2 > HEADING 3: This is a third hypothetical note that is semantically similar to the notes I am looking for.",
)
```

The "lookup" tool will then return a dictionary of results that are semantically similar to the hypothetical notes you provided.
