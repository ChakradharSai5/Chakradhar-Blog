- Idea of making business in applying jobs area with customer care and clarity, having all their details and coming up as and when required 
	- we will take all the details of customer or aspirant, and we will see to which jobs he will be eligible to apply, as and when he gets eligible to something new we will intimate him, if he is ok, we will apply as well
- - that course where we can ask questions that are being answered by AI, but not an AI that just answering from course contentes we kept course doer to read but, an AI that has been trained with large data of unshown, repetitive, more complex data- data that data that we have not shown to general course enroller/doer, but we want him to know incase if he wants more clarity or more detail, so that his doubts gets cleared also we donâ€™t have to go off track in our course to help him understand, also overwhelm with all the not-so-irrelavant things that he dosen't need know
- Idea- same kind of above idea, say I have huge data in One note, I will have an AI software tool that I install in my PC, I will make certain AI tools, each tool for different purpose, say one AI tool, I will train it with data from my huge data in On note, that particular AI tool is trained to answer questions from my particular Onenote data, ofcourse That software need to be trained/disigned in such a way to have logical conversations, but it can answer only from my huge data of one note, without judging/validation of correctness, just simply answers from the data given
- Idea- Microsoft or any noteapp tools can lauch such kind of AI help tool, that helps user to navigate through the data user already has, and answers from the notes he has.
