### Gear mechanism of Starter motor  
- pinion has to have heavy torque, as it has to rotate  fly wheel, along with compression of air fuel miture for combustion- that is connected to flywheel is need to done, and engine has to go decent speed atleast 100rpm- if less,then less suction will be in cylinders.
- due to reduction of gear teeth from pinion(here 8) and flywheel(112), torque from pinion gets multiplied 14times, even with  of torque mutliplication, it is toruqe will not be enough, so
- [[planet gears]] - 6 times, so total, of 6 times 14 is 84 times
- so for one rotaion of fly wheel, our pinion rotates 84times, and so torque from pinon getes multiplied 84times

### Starter motor

- starter motor is single biggest load of battery use in the car
	- takes lot of current compared to other loads like headlight, radiator etc
	- and so requires thickest big fat cable- so follow thickest cable in the car to find the starter motor
	- Thats because, what we do is for starting motor we are giving supply from battery only, and battery got only 12V, for higher watt power from this battery requires higher current, as we need high watt usage for start of motor


### Relay
- as we need heavy current to pass to our motor, and as that requires heavy wire, we also shall need big switch if I were to use a switch in this thick cable line, which is what used to be in early car usage
- Later we derived a way to control this heavy current circuit, using smaller current circuit using relay
- here specially what we did is we used the same solenoid we use for movment of pinion to engage it with flywheel, as a relay


### Preengagement
- To make pinion to easily engage into flywheel, we use bevel shape teeth and also while plunger moves sidewards, we make this pinion rotate slightly, (which happens parallelly to or before the motor starts) called preengagement

- We use one way clutch system, which is kind of like bearing used for motor to not get motored back from flywheel
### Safety switch
- gets enabled only when vehicle in nuetral gear or clutch is completely pressed
