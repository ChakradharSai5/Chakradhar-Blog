1,000=kilo = thousand = 10 ^3
1,000,000 = million = 1000 thousands = 10 ^6 =10 lakhs
1,000,000,000 = billion = 1000 million= 10^9 =100 crores
1,000,000,000,000 = trillion = 1000 billion = 10 ^12 = 1 lakh crores

1000 = thousand
1,00,000 = 1 lakh = 10^5
10,00,000 = 10 lakh = 10 ^6
100,00,000 = 100 lakhs  = 1 crore = 10 ^7

- Land area conversion
	- 1 gajamu is 1/4th ankanam, 9 square feet, one yard
	- 1 acre is 4840 square yards, and so, 1210 ankanas
		- for easy calculation imagine an anknam, and divide it into 4 equal boxes using a big plus sign, each square box in 1 gajam or square yard
	- 1 cent is 48 yards, that is 12 ankan
	- 1 Cent is 1/00th of an acre, i.e 435Sq.Ft

1 dollar = 83ruppees
1 million dollar = 8.3 Crores
1 billion dollar = 8300 Crores
