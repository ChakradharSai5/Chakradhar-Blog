## Dew point

- Dew point is a temperature point below which any fluid(gas or liquid) cannot hold the moisture content in it and so it lets out the moisture by forming droplets on the surface of its contact to any it's contact surface
- In our case we mainly use it for hydrogen, in cooling purpose of generator
- usually we need pressure, temperature and moisture content in it to calculate dew point
- the "dew point" is the temperature at which a gas reaches a state of saturation with moisture, and at this temperature, the gas can no longer hold all of its moisture content. As a result, any further cooling or a decrease in temperature causes the excess moisture to condense onto surfaces as tiny liquid droplets, similar to how dew forms on surfaces in the morning. The dew point marks the temperature at which this condensation process begins.
- For example
    - For hydrogen, say at 4ksc pressure , and around 50C, with very less moisture content, the dew point shall be around -50C,
    - In stage-1 TSTPS generator our design dew point is +10C, so we don't want our hydrogen to go below 10C, if so it forms droplets on the contact surface point where it reaches 10C
