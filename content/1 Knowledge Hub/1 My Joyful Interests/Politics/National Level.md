- UP - Yogi adityanath in competetion with his current Dy. chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, & 
	- K P Maurya - OBC Leader,  Uttar Pradesh BJP State adhyakshudu
- Even in 2017, BJP did not declare Yogi as its CM candidate, only with Modi name they went to election in 2017, shows Modi and AMit Shah were never interested in making Yogi their CM candidate, their initial plan was to make Manoj sinha as CM, but with Yogi's aggresive Hindutva style of politics made him popular and quite a strong state leader that BJP(Modi & Amit Shah) were forced to make Yogi as CM as a political compromise
- After becoming CM, Yogi made himself get a following and popularity in people & even in BJP workers, and in total country he emerged as Hintuva political Icon, his caste Thakur following he made strong, he made them stood behind him, so much it became quite difficult to Modi & Amit in making Yogi unsettle, 
- Because any national party doesn't support a strong uprising state leaders, like in the case of Rajasekhar Reddy, RR overcame it to great extent, and that was in Congress, same goes for BJP
- So, how to unsettle Yogi withoug Unsettling BJP in UP
- in Past from BJP
	- Kalyan singh
	- Yadyurappa
	- Uma bharati, all these 3 left BJP and later joined or something like that
	- in Rajasthan Vasundhar Raj Sindhya
	- Madhya pradesh Siva Raj singh chowhan
	- Uttar Pradesh Rajnath Singh
	- Maharashtra Nitin Gadkari - these 3 were made to come to parliatment and made them as cabinet part to not let them grow as local strong leaders,
- either they were made as weak leaders in local, by making them irrevealant, like vasundhara mentioned, if not possible to make irrelavant, they were made to come to national politics and made to to cabin minister with Modi(as prime minister) and then control them, like Rajnath singh, sushma swaraj, recently shiv raj singh chowhan & nitin gadkari
- And so Modi & Yogi, have always tried to find ways to put check to Yogi, like
	- K P Maurya(OBC Community) & Brajesh Pathak(Brahmin Community) were made Deputy CM beside Yogi and control him, couldn't happen
	- Then Gujarat IAS officer - A K sharma Modi's good follower & kind of friend, were made to Voluntary retirement and made him enter to UP politics, even that couldn't work, as Yogi made him just a minister using his clever witty ways, escaped that also, there were big rumors that A K sharma shall be very well used to control Yogi which did not go as planned by Modi & Amit
	- Then as CM's cheif secretary, Durga shankar Mishra was sent to control Yogi, that also did not work, even in his tenure as CS he couldn't contorl Yogi, that was the Yogi's powerful Clout
	- they even tried to bring to national politics and make him weak in local politics, to cut the base he has in Uttar pradesh, but Yogi's own strenght and his nature - that he may even revolt against the BJP - and may so leave them, they feared in making strong attempt to do that, & even RSS support
But now with this parliament results of 2024, BJP lost severely in Uttar Pradesh from 62 Seats in 2019 to 33 seats now in 2024, Yogi critics got great opportunity, that Maurya & Pathak (Deputy CMs) went and met Modi & Amit many times.
		- what happened is not only is BJP is lost, also BJP is lost because of only Hindutva politics, akhilesh yadav - Samajwadi party - strong opposition party in Uttar Pradesh, was able to get INDIA alliance seats 43 , that's because Akhilesh Yadav were able to consolidate OBC votes and other non-Hindutva & even some hindutva votes
		- so this social community politics, this social engineering of Akhilesh is what is strong and so able to beat this even hindutva politics is what narration made by both Depty CMs & also partly true
		- Also narration made by K P maurya that this happened because of Thakur's domination, OBC community ignoring, and even in BJP workers level, Yogi is not able to get to bottom level, there's a gap between top leadership and bottom karyakartalu etc
- Currently Modi & Amit kept this problem slightly postponed, because Bye-elections of 10 assembly, in that 5 seats are of Samajvad party, and only 2 is BJP, remaining 3 BJP+allies seats, so it is understood that if Yogi is able to pull off great in this bye-elections, he will be made continue by You know who, if otherwise like in parliament elections BJP again lose - definelty you know who shall make Yogi pay
Even with all this, they cannot directly make Yogi to get to natoional politics as after Modi & Amit shah, he is BJP's star campainger, if his made to cabinet, he will emerge as next modi, so touching Yogi has one problem, and continuing him makes another problem
