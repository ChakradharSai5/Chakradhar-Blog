- Like nag ashwin, or like arvind kejriwal, rajamouli they want something be it type of a movie, or type of society, or they want to tell a story, they just want that.
- They don't have skills for that, they don't have resources for that, but they decided they want it and they realized they cannot live without it,
    - Arvind Kejriwal was once asked did you do any corruption/ taken any bribe while working as IAS office, he responded saying "he will not get sleep, he simply couldn't sleep if he did"
    - That kind of conviction they simply can't live without it, sa
    - Same with pawan kalyan, he couldn't forgive himself if he did a corruption, he just simply can't live with himself.
- I know they all turned out to be became like that somehow, be it their experiences in life they went through, be it their studies made them, be it books they read etc., whatever may be the reason, they ended up being a person who cannot live with themselves if they were to do corruption, or a person who cannot stop themselves from seeing corruption/injustice and simply ignoring it, They cannot stop themselves from coming out and taking hardships of convincing people, They simply cannot live the other way.
    - Incase of Nag aswhin, or rajamouli, they simply cannot not do it, they really really want to tell a story, a moving/inspiring story. They simply cannot not do it. They cannot afford to not do it. So that motivated them to learn all skills, and to learn strategies, and to learn all ways to get there whatever they want.
- Incase of me, I really want to have good body, a good low fat percentage body, that is why I learnt all about food, or exercises or diet or nutritious food etc., I realized that I cannot not do it. There is no other way for me. I have to do it
- The bottom line I want to tell is, I want to tell there are many people in this world who just wants something, but there are very less people who really really want something like mentioned above people.
    - What makes the difference, I think it is the clarity in thought of what they want. The people I have mentioned above they also might have started journey by just wanting it, but soon as they get to know/see clearly what they want, the more clearly they see it, the more they get interested to take action to get it.
- So I think clarity of what you want is more important, rather than just wanting it, get clear on what you want and be honest with yourself are you going to get what you want by being like this?, then you start to realize that you can't afford sit and relax as you will clearly start to see that by not taking action you are losing something you want ,
- Also the more clarity on what you want, the more clearer you get the lesser jealousy you are going to feel. Bcs why would you?, you know what you want right?, and you are working towards it right? Then what's the difference does it make if he achieving or not
- Identify your triggers from which **you can identify your values**:
    1. I get triggered when somebody don't know something and speaks as if they know that so I think I value stating clearly things by knowing and understanding as clearly as possible
        1. EX: simham talking about GMC some topics, as if he knows that, actually he is not making sense
    2. People doing acting, as if they like
- Whatever you do in this life, it's not legendary unless your friends and family is there to see it.
    - Barney stinson
- The perons confidence by taking action on somehting you stood
    - Two ways to live a life, let's happen what happens
    - Or take responsibility,
- And imagine confidence of person who's working hard and the way he clearly, claritily speaks, the way he be fun to be around with, the way he explains things
    - Ex: NOT Simham, NOT insecure person.
    - Kind of some part of puru, prudhvi
- • Imagine if a portal opened up and the person and the person stepped out was the best version of yourself, person who possesed everything you wished you ever had, you can see that right?, you see that version of you already exists, so point your effort direction to that side
- • I want to be proper expert in something, that I am certain that I am an expert, with full confidence
