Tom cruise working attitude- and he said, this dosen't come with luck, you have to will and work for it, the only way.

Remember you don't want to end up like Sanjay sir in 10 years, who is craving for promotion to get out of this place but can't do anything so there's a chance to get out of this place, just leave ., he's so not interested to stay here, you don't want at age 45 to end up a place like this where your kids don't have proper enjoying childhood with proper facilities, priority enjoying and roaming places to go. For that it has to be near City

Work hard for that

Be ready for any bad thing to happen, being ready means be prepared means be in such a strong routine and strong organzied with  knowledge life that if any bad thing happens like Sanjay sir bad location transfer from bad location , be in a position to grab opportunity in any

Remember, you don't want to end up like first episode of Breaking bad where, he gets her hj out of pity, You don't want anything in life from anyone out of pity. Work hard and inspire others.

Your expertise on things should be at that level that for helping others, it should not cost you much but for them it should be of big help. This can be by following two things

- 1. Get clarity as much as you can
- 2. Do thing quick and easy way

Be ruthlessly ambitious, it's ok - Jordon B peterson

It isn't about happiness, You gotta be ready for life's lot of disease, pain of yours or loved ones, death & struggle, So question is how do you want to be when it comes. when the damn flood comes, you gotta be the person you built the arc

Remind yourself that yes you have lost a lot by bad choices with insecurities but it is on your  hands now to choose future about health, career , relationship
