- I noticed Sravya facing this psycholoical compel of eing fearful and constanntly thinking hat she may hurt somebody and so being so she distacncing heerswlf from enjoying social life to a huge extent
- This is mostly because how her parents treated while she was child. As a child she was being constatnly monitored by her mom that she will be loved only she behaves well with others, and that means to not hurt anyone
- She was constantly being compared to other cousins, saying they are more beutiful, saying that her cousins, are very good, made sravya think that she wasn't being loved,
- Though now she realized that mom and dad loves her more, asubconsious habit of tip toeing while talking/baheving with other to not cause a lsight chance of hurting other became dangerouly harmful to her
### Solutions:
	1. The solution I find ok for ther to not think what otehr are thining while talking to them, jus tell/behave like what you wnt to tell/how you want to behave,just don't even think of tit
	2. To make sure she is understood and feel that I ahve her no matter what, I alawys love her, so she can feel secure and safe, being herself around me atleast

PS: This second point applies in parenting also
