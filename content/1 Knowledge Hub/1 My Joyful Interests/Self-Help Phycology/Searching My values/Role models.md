### Here this note is to note things I like, and to derive why I like those things, what exactly I value in that, by identifying that I can lead more such directional intentional life
- Prasanth kishor role model, like Jordon Peterson, but Indian, that self knowing, and confidence from the knowing self and embracing self, the way he talks and the way enjoys work is what I admire, I think that's what I value- The way one works so much that they like that work - they like to be in that state of flow of that work- thinking about nothing
- I think how Keanu being Keanu, how though he faced such things in life, he is kinder is because, he's just busy doing things he love, so ultimately just do things, DONT **NOT** DO things, do something or other **always just do something, JUST DO NOT SIT BACK AND RELAX** , and make that doing  **INTENTIONAL** i.e. the doing is taking in the direction you want to go, and be honest with yourself while doing, before doing, after doing
 ###  Daniel Craig as fit and wearing a rolex watch, with fit body
 ### Jim Carrey as role model while he stays normal, his confidence I think #pending 
 ### Surya of that jai bheem mvoie movie role model- his style of working 
 ### one of the major thing I value is expertise, I value it very much, So I want to get it in any one of the field
