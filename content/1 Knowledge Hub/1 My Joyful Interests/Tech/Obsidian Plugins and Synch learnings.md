### Google Project
There's main thing called Project
	-  and in that we have many APIs available like apps, we can enable any API we want
	-  and to that project itself, we can create credentials, of 3 categories
		- API keys
		- OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
		- Service accounts
	- And this credential is to be created for one or more enabled APIs

Through various experiments, these are some of things I found
1. Using Imgur plugin, which shall use it's own clien ID and Client secret for authentication, Imgur shall upload your pic to its website, and keeps it accesible through embed code(NOT LIKE google photos), greate advantage using Imgur is simply drag and drip to obsidian page shall make it to upload and automatically keeps the embeds link of that uploaded image. There is an option of anonymous upload of image, which shall make the image 100% public and so no privacy. but downside is no privacy in photos uploaded.
2. Google photos is a good plugin, if you are ok with just thumbnail display in obsidian, (offline stored), and have a link attached with thumbnail that is connected to original full clarity photo, This plugin also uses client secret and client ID and using Google photos API in console project, but, unlike Imgur plugin our photo shall not be publicly availbale, as this can take photo from google photos plugin and not upload to online like Imgur
