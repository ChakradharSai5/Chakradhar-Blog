- Erpedu land of Thatha/Bharani mama
	- 56 Cents of land, in that only 6 cents is mentioned in the document as Thatas, remaining as some DKT, and so into litigation
	- it all started with Thata's mena mama who didn't marry was in erpedu ashramam,but due to some reason he got in to quarell with ashramam people and came out of ashramam, before coming out of that he bought a piece of land 56 Cents from an old man
	- later Thata's mena mama, as he didn't marry any one, he wrote to Thata and died, Thata had those documents, and we even did pooja to that mena mama's samadhi every year, I remember it slightly, which is in that land itself.
	- after some years govt did survey of land, asked who are all owners of that land to come and claim, but neighther thatha nor bharani mama went, as they were too busy with their own things
	- then in 2005 somebody put a case in court, saying that peice of land is theirs, thata fought with that up to I guess 2011 with a lawyer in hyderabad and finally won in 2011.
	- then court ordered the local authorities to change the name on the papers to thata's name
	- but the local authorities, mro, tahasildharand sub registrar i think, they all kummaku and they did not do it, here our side blunder is thata or bharani mama did not cross check if they have changed the name in the origianl land records, they simply didn't check it was updated or not for around 4 years because again in 2015 
	- so again in 2015 somebody again put case saying it is theirs, but again in court, they started spending money for lawyers and tahsildhar and mro bribing and you know about bharani mama, how he wastes money and how he believes money for giving it to people
		- ok one of incident is they were told to meet a tahasilhdar who apparently will do the work, so they gave around 5 lakhs, and with a gold coin placed on taambulam on a plate with dress - shit like this.
		- Atthat suffred a lot, like goint to somebody home daily by attha and mama, and somewhere they got cheeti money 5 lakh and that also they spent on it, they say they spent around 1 crore on it. Finally it got released in 2021 something.
	- Before all this happening or while this thing happening many poeple came to buy it but nobody to buy it
	- Later after all this, now in 2023/24, Later after all this, now somebody bought it from here that somebody got huge properties and this is small.thing for them, they gave 5lakh to sub registrar and got it registered to their name, then that person who bought said they will give land i think they already gave some part near mangalam and -btw mangalam area 90k/ankanam- and many parts of land is yet to be given that's pending- which initially that person asked to get mama to get it registered first,
	- but due to bad luck and partly mama's nature, he initially was almost to register that land, but to due to network issue couldn't, later when we were ready went for registration he denied of doing it. 
	- Later only mama registered our erpedu land to his name But he gave only part land, Even till today attha and mama waiting for him to give full remaining land, especially attha frequently calls them and ask for that, but now what no what happened is somebody again put a litigation on that land and so that person who bought it is now he is getting to give the money and kind of saying that he will he will give later now atta asked yesterday that are you going to pay only when the litigation gets cleared and the persons at your so only obsceniting it's scared will going to pay you this is part of the problem and there are many layer Street and she has saying that I am Venky did not sign in the registered documents so there is no need to panic I don't know what that means
- The main mistakes they did is from 2011 to 2014 nobody to cross check the details land, Anna Nagar mistake is not putting any compound wall or board or any name written on it
