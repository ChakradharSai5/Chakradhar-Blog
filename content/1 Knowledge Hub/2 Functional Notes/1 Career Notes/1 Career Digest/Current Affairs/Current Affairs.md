## Current affairs

- Currently 202-24 ED of Sipat- who worked here- at kaniha as GM-Operation I think, is one of the option of RED
- And our N S Rao is also on line for RED
- And if so, BARH GM O&M - Dehury, or Kaniha GM O&M -A K sehgal can become ED of either of sipat or kaniha
- Currently only prashant behera looking after house keeping
- This year 2023, 17 out of 44 people got promoted from E6 to E7, senior manager to DGM




- Here at kaniha, for Ash dyke for st-1 or st-2 new pond acquired by ntpc, for around 150 acres, for that ntpc paid 75lakhs for 2 acres
- In around 2019 or 20, E4 posts of PE came, requirement of C&I background, our batchmates saksham, bansal and arnab mukharjee applied and got it, Vimal was also in C&I at that time, but he couldn't apply as he did not had enough experince, and they required only 3 posts
- As said by [[Ashok sir kaniha]], GM-FM will have more importance compared to GM_Operations or GM-O&M to go to top management, same way our current GM O&M rama krishna became GM O&M from GM-FM, next he may become HOP


- During transfers, as otherwise people are using jugaad, These day usually it is given 7 days time for relieving
