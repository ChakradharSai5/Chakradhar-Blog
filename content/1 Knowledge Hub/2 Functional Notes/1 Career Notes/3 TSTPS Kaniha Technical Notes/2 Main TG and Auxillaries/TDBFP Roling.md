1.  Revise [[TDBFP]] [[Pni]]
2.  [[TDBFP]] turbine should be in barring, ensure dump valve open, recirculation CV open, Discharge valve open or close, depends on other turbine running or not
3. give engage command, coupling pump should start, ensure in local that pump got started, there's a panel in local for coupling pump
4. engage feedback comes, ensure pump rotation as turbine still in barring- by seeing in local that pump is actually rotating slowly
5. now stop the barring, disengage the barring in local
6. now reset the trip reset the turbine, 
7. Now generates the trip oil by pulling lever, around 9ksc, in local pressure gauge also see, and confirm, slowly release the lever
8. now close the dump valves and ensure opening of HPSV and LPSV in local and also feedback in DCS console
9. now give 1100 rpm see LPCV opening, and so later HPCV opening after LPCV opening at around 70%
10. after 1100rpm, soaking for 20mins or impulse chamber temp reach 120DegC whichever is earlier
11. then directly 3000rpm, then, observe suction flow improvement
12. after that go ahead and give pulse



## TDBFP rolling

1. Turbine trip reset
2. Engage Cmd, ensure coupling pump start and engage feedback
3. Ensure main pump rotating in local
4. Stop barring motor, disengage it
5. Generate trip oil by dragging lever
6. Close dump valves, and ensure LP and HP stop valves open
7. If pump permissive also availble, 1100 rpm and start
8. Impulse chamber temp >120 or 20min waiting
