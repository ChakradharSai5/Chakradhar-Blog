- Meggering:
	- Resistance measured from Body- which is earthed- to supply terminal
	- Meggering value to be around some 100s of Mega ohms, if it is less to around say 2Mega Ohm , it indicates some insulation problem 
- Phase Imbalance
	- IR value is measured, to find any imbalance between any 2 of three phases 
	- this shows if any short between any one of these phases
	- Ideally they should have open circuit resistance
