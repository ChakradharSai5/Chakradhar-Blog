- There is a guy recently joined in TMD-manager, he is from Haridwar inspection office
    - There are many places of inspection offices in NTPC, haridwar, Calcutta, Tirichi
    - He also worked in Jajjar
    - The way inspection offices work is we from here- project or station, will order something from vendor through PR, later when product got bulk delivered by him, nearest office of inspection will inspect it and only then after their certification can the order shipped to delivery to location
    - high chances of corruption is there is what i heard from PC Tudu
