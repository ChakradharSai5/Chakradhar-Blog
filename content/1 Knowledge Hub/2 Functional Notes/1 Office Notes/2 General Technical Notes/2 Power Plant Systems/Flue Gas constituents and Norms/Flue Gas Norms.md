## • Controlling and norms on flue gas
?
- Nox limit
    - before 2003 commissioned plants has 600mg/Nm3, so Kaniha has 600mg/Nm3
<!--SR:!2024-07-05,1,230-->

    - after 2004-2016 commissioned plants has 300mg/Nm3

        70–90 per cent of total air given at burner, leading partial combustion of fuel, and balance is injected above burner elevation, where combustion gets completed, the relatively low temp. of secondary stage limits the production of thermal Nox

        - To reduce _thermal_ Nox we can use OVF,basically total air is not given right away at burner, some part of air given at above all burners, so that near burner localized O2 deficit happens and so reduces NOx ,
- SOx limit
    - 600mg/Nm3 for less than 500MW,
    - 200mg/Nm3 for greater than or equal to 500MW, so Kaniha 200mg/Nm3![[pUCt1Sn - Imgur.jpg]]

- SPM limit is 50mg/Nm3
- CO limit??
