## Flue Gas constituents
- Fuel has C,H,N,S
### Normal reaction
?
- which gives us the energy
    - C + 02 ---> Co2 + some 8000kcal energy
    - To ensure this, we require O2, so we give oxygen through air flow
    - If less oxygen given another problem is
	    - C + 1/2 O ---> CO,+ some 4000kcal energy, both energy inefficient and norm issue
    - So we need to give excess air, to ensure only C02 reaction
    - But giving excess air adds N2 also to combustion
    - N + O2 ----> NOx (NO, NO2, N2O)(90-95% is NO), at around 1300C temp.
        - Fuel Nox - that comes from N of Fuel- , 70-80% is this,
        - Thermal Nox - that comes from the N of air we are giving, 5-25% is this.
    - N2O - a green house gas- not usually present in fuel burning - only traces in ppb - so no need to worry about it
    - So not too excess air as it increases NOx formation
        - So just around 2-4% excess O2 is given
### Nox Emission specifically
?
- Gas firing gives around 100-150ppm
	- Gas firing is long gone as costly, and clean up cost - to remove emissions - is too high
- Oil firing gives around 250-400ppm, 'cause  oil has hydro carbons linked to N
 #### Bad 'cause
- inhibits respiratory function, damages vegetation
- cause acid rain deposition
- ozone damage
 #### Its formation?
- Fuel Nox
	- 'cause of N in fuel, example: NH3
 - Thermal Nox
	- is what we talked in [[Flue Gas constituents#Normal reaction]] - as mentioned in it - formation due to oxidation
- Prompt Nox - *Not needed*
- N20- *Not needed*
- NNH - At very high temperatures- like welding torches- *Not needed*

#### How to control Nox Emissions??
?
- High Furnace Temp. gives more Nox
	- can't decrease, as production gets affected
	- predicted Nox with temp. in ppm, this graph expla![[FOvHtfk - Imgur.png]]ined [[Nox graph explained]]
	
		-  So temperature control is really important, so we reduce hotspots, and give a uniform distribution of flame
- Fuel constituents
	- can't control- obviously
- Excess Air
	- as said in [[Flue Gas constituents#Normal reaction]], keep it under 2-4 % for your production to be ok, don't go overboard.
		- if so two losses-
			- 1.inefficient, as the excess air must be heated and losted to atmospere eventually
			- 2. High Nox, obviously
- Combustion air temperature
	- preheating the air that gets in to boiler though APH
	 -
	 - we usually go by around 280DegC, so around 600F.
	 - as Air pre heat good for efficiency, bad for Nox

- Also S + O2 ---> SO2+ some 2000kcal energy
    - Even excess O2 gives further SO3, so mostly SO2
- SPM
- Water vapour
- Very slight heavy metals
