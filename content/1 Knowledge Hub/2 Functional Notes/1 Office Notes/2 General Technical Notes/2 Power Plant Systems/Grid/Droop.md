### Droop rate
- Is something given by manufacturer, here our droop rate is 5%, that is,  the manufacturer is saying that, when grid due to frequency variation if grid squeezes in 500MW my TG shall unload by 5% of rated speed(3000rpm), that is 2850rpm . Similarly, if grid squeezes out 500MW TG shall gets loaded by 5% of rated speed (3000rpm) that is to 3150rpm
- So what we do is, from graph of X 0 to 500MW & Y 3000rpm to 3150rpm, we get 150rpm to 500MW, and so 1rpm to 3.33MW
- When a steam turbine is connected to an electrical grid, it needs to maintain a stable speed or frequency to ensure the reliability of the electricity supply. The droop setting determines how the turbine responds to changes in the electrical load.
- In a droop control system, as the electrical load on the turbine increases, the speed of the turbine decreases. This decrease in speed is intentional and helps to share the load among multiple turbines connected to the grid
