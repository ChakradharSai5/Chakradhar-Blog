### TSE
?
- main thing is we measure one 100% depth surface temp. and another 50% depth temperature for
	- casing
	- shaft
- 100% depth is called Ti
- 50% depth is called Tm
- Now you see, for casing, both are actually measured physically using, thermocouple or something
- for shaft Ti is measured actually, Tm is calculated as, Tm cannot be measured phyisically as the shaft will rotate
	- Tm will be calculated from Ti and time I thing #pending
