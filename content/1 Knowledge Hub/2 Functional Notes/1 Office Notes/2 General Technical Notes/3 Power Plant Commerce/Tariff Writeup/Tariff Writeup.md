## Tariff Write up
- Electricity act 2003 - CERC
	- CERC gave 2004-09 regulations, later 2009-14 regulations, then 2014-2019 regulations
**Simply there are two ways to recover money invested/spent by power producer**
1. recovery of AFC, that is annual fixed charge, or capacity charge - this is basically calculated for a year, that is this cost is taken from the spends of company that has already taken place, or spends that are going to be roughly fixed for this year
2. recovery of Fuel costs, or variable charge or energy charge, this is fuel costs and other variable costs, that vary dynamically
These below details are for 2014-19, specifics may change every 5 years, but philosophy is gonna be same
### Capacity charge
- ROE- 15.5% 
	- this is Return on Equity, we know for power plants, as per regulations, equity:debt is 30:70 % investment, so this 30% investment of equity - that is own money shall be interested at 15.5%
- Interest on loan
	- this is interest of that 70%, regulation states, this shall be at rate how much ever company is paying that borrower
- Depreciation
	- notice that the above 2 were just interests, what about principle?, well this the principle, here that principle shall be catered yearly some fixed percentage, up to 25 years, till the valuation gets to 95% I guess, apparently meaning the things/machinery you had bought gets valued to 5% of how much ever it had been bought 25 years ago.
- Interest on working capital
	- this is assuming you need some working capital, say 15 days coal at immediate disposal in hand ALWAYS, shall mean you have buy this thing keep it reserve all the time, same goes with spares, this is called working capital
	- now this working capital, how much, shall be fixed or "norm"ed by regulatory authority, but for that working capital, the interest is this one
- O&M costs
	- this are operation and maintanance for the machinery and services received, people getting paid, employee benifts etc, this also "norm"ed by CERC
	- mentioned as say 25Lakh/MW
- secondary oil
	- it is understood that we do need some oil for various requirements, so what CERC did is "ok, I understand you have to use oil, ok, so use this much only" and "norm"ed it and so, as it is also fixed this is taken under AFC
	- currently 0.5ml/kWhr, I think
- R&M costs
	- if requirement be, if any R&M done, that also shall gets to R&M costs
### Energy charges
- Just the coal consumption and I am not sure if something else also, like water

## Example for better understanding

### Given Data
1. Capacity of Plant 500 MW
2. Capital Cost 4 Cr/MW 
3.  Debt Equity Ratio 70:30
4. Return on Equity 15.5% 
5. Interest on Loan 10% 
6. Working Capital (10% of Total Capital)
7. Interest on working Capital 10%
8. Depreciation Rate 5.28%
9. Operation and Maintenance cost 13 Lakh/MW 
10. Plant Load Factor (PLF) 80% 
11. Plant Availability Factor 85%
12. Specific Oil Consumption 10 ml/MW 
13. Price of Oil Rs. 10,000/Kl
14. Gross Calorific value of Oil 10,000 Kcal/Lit 
15. Station Heat Rate 2,425 Kcal/Lit
16. Cost of Coal Rs.1000 / Tones 
17.  Auxiliary Power Consumption 6.50%
18.  Plant Life (For thermal plant based on Coal) 25 Years 
19. Gross Calorific value of coal 4000 Kcal/K
