## **Any Ovation System:**

- WT- WARM UP TIME, Time required for warm up i.e conditions satisfy, Pr or Temp for next step
- MT- METERING TIME- Meters the time of running step
- RT- RUNTIME- Time actually that step has run
- NOTE: If the sequence is not running, just see the WT warm up time for all steps(some steps may get skipped so read the steps also) that will tell you how much time that sequence is supposed to take, If sequence is running , RT will tell you how much actually that particular sequence is taking.
