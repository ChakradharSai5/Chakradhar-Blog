- Rotor earth fault issue:
    - Due slight passing of bearing 6 oil catcher MOT oil getting spilled out and is being sucked to excitation chamber causing rotor slight earthing as rotor is exposed as brushes kept in contact to rotor
    - So what they did is they kept an air line between bearing 6 and excitation chamber to get the oil not coming in to excitation chamber
