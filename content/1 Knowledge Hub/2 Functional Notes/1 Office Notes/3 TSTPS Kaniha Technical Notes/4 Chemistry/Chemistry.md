- ACC may increase because of condensor tube leakage, 
- High chances of rapid increase if especially it is with sea water, like in [[NTPC simhadri]]
- Na, Spefic conductivity and ACC values are almost the main indiaction of condensor tube leakage like what they do in simhadri exact values to be maintained to  be known #pending
