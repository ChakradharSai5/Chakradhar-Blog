- Protection details:
    - Trips on HP Pr. High > 18ksc
        - Happens if CT belt got snapped or OH tank level low
        - That is I think, if CT water temperature gets increased, 
    - Trips on LP Pr. Low <2.5ksc
        - Happens if gas filling required
    - Chiller O/o temp <6C
        - Heavy cooling,  because with that low temperature damages tubes of compressor
- Make up is available from drinking/ Clarifier water
