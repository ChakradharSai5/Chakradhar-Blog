Delta P= − (∑ ULSP)

- So for changing delta p( = AGC correction)
    - You can either change ULSP(affects inversely)
    - Or you can limit AGC SP coming from NLDC by changing unit load capabilities(affects proportionally )

## AGC

- Primary control – RGMO/FGMO

Secondary control – AGC

Incentive @ 50ps/kwhr of over and above normative energy

Teritirary control-  RRAS

- Here at kaniha, in CMC, the MW demand signal that is getting generated is
	- Setpoint - AGC correction
	- **NOT** setpoint - AGC correction - RGMO, 
- so that means I guess this RGMO command is directly going to Turbine command after this MW demand signal from CMC #pending
