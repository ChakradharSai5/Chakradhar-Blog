## **POINTS TO PONDER:**

- on‐line fire‐side cleaning of heat‐absorbing surfaces.
- to prevent section of the boiler from becoming severely blocked
    - Blocked sections can restrict gas flow and cause tube erosion due to high local gas velocitie
- wall blowers
    - furnace wall cleaning
- Lrsb
    - to clean the Super heaters, Reheater and Economiser areas.
- The soot blowing made of materials have inadequate strength when subjected to the temperature above 6000C.
- The long retractable type soot blower is the most effective way to clean radiant and convective heating surfaces.
- The clearance between the boiler tubes and lance both horizontal & vertical with respect to lance has to be maintained as per the manufacturer’s recommendations i.e. (100 mm in horizontal and 150mm in vertical) when the lance is fully extended condition.
## **DURING SOOT BLOWING:**

- LRSB:
    - 400 Simplex Opn
    - 450 MW for Duplex Opn
- WB
    - 375 MW

## **TRIP COMMITTIE RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- to be avoided if Sp coal>0.9 Kg/Kwh & Unit Load <450 MW. If required, oil support may be taken during Soot Blowing.
- Mill Changeover / Taking of additional milling system in service should be avoided during Soot Blowing
- In case of low load operation ( <375 MW, Tech Min load), LRSB & WB operation must not be skipped & has to be done in Simplex Mode necessarily with oil support( with at least one elevation with 3 oil guns i/s).
- Mode of operation:
    - Draft –10mmwlc
    - Supply steam temp adequate>= 300C
    - Supply steam Pr.
    - SB drain temp >=270C
    - Availability of hand cranking levers

## **EMERGENCY OPERATION OF SB:**

- If loss of blowing medium when the lance is inserted then it is to be retract immediately, otherwise mechanical failure will take place.
- Do not operate the same blower in quick succession. At least one hour cooling period before subsequent operation is a must to avoid any damage to the motor windings.
- **LRSB gets stuck up:**
    - If P/S fails, the blower should be immediately brought to its starting position manually to avoid any possible damage
    - If overload it is to be reset
    - Immediately SB steam header pressure to be reduced from 28 KSC to 5KSC
    - The above pressure is to be maintained for about 15 min, if not got retracted by then
    - Retracting LRSB mechanically is likely to take about 45 mins.
    - After 1 hour, the steam pressure is to be reduced to zero.
