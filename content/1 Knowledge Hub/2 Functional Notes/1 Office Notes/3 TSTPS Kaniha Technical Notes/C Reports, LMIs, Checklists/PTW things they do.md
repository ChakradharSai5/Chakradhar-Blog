- Generator Shaft voltage measurement
	- weekly or periodly they do check voltage of generator shaft at Turbine end and excitor end, two measurements and AC & DC #ClarityLess
	- some DC voltage & AC voltage from the shaft using a big rod which has brush at one end will be touched to shaft and other end to ground, AC and DC voltage will be measured, as per EMD this will tell if any short circuit faults, usually the voltage should be very high
