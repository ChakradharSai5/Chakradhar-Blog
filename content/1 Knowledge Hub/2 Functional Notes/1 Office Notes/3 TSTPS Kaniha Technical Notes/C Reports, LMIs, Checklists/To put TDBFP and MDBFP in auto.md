- after synch and load increasing with feedwater increase with LLCV
	- put TD and MD in auto before opening FW of FRS so that the change in flow due to FRS opening can be catered by Feedwater master in auto
	- to put MD in auto, just see the 3 speed loops CLCS page, internal deriving scoop signal from feedwater signal to be almost matched with current scoop you are maintaining, since usually we will have a range of margin in feedwater flow maintaining from 900Tph to 1000Tph, you can adjust the scoop accordingly and then put it in auto
	- after that you can put TD in auto, if remote permissive is available and suction flow of both BFP maintaining around same value and recirculation CV of TD in  already closed condition
