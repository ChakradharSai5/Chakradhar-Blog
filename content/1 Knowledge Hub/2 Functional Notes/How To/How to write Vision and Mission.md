# Write a mission and vision

- Vision vs Mission: **while writing 5 year vision vs mission statements**
    - **VISION:**
        - ****Vision statement:
            - It should never end
                - Ex: Microsoft: A personal computer on every desk and in every home running Microsoft software
            - Focuses on future
            - Who do you want or what kind of a life you want
            - What kind of life you want
            - What mental state you want to be ?
            - What would you want you to be doing?
            - clear and inspiring description of an individual's desired future
            - It outlines the ideal state of their life
            - ow they envision themselves in the long term
            - concentrates on aspirations and the future.
- It's why we do what we do
- Questions to ask for vision:
    1. What kind of impact do I want to make in this world or my community
    2. Where do I see myself in 5, 10, 20 years?
    3. What legacy do I want to leave behind, what you want to be remembered for
    4. What are my core passions and interests?
    5. What does success mean to me?
- They serve different purposes, with the mission statement addressing the "what" and "how," and the vision statement addressing the "where" or "why."
- Focus on the Future: A vision statement, on the other hand, is future-oriented. It outlines the long-term aspirations and goals of the organization. It describes what the organization envisions becoming or achieving in the future.
- Inspirational and Strategic: Vision statements are more inspirational and strategic. They inspire and motivate stakeholders by painting a picture of the desired future state. They provide a clear direction for where the organization wants to go.
- Broad and High-Level: Vision statements are typically broader and high-level in their descriptions. They don't get into the specific day-to-day activities but instead describe the ultimate impact and position the organization aims to have in the future.
- **MISSION:**
    - Focuses on present
    - Ex: microsoft: Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
    - What you want to do now, how you approach life to reach the vision that stated
    - represents a concise and clearly articulated statement that defines the core purpose, values, and goals of an organization or individual
    - Focus on the Present: A mission statement is primarily focused on the present. It defines the core purpose of the organization and outlines what it is currently doing, who it is serving, and how it is serving them. It addresses the "why" and "how" of the organization's existence in the here and now.
    - Operational and Tactical: Mission statements are more operational and tactical in nature. They provide guidance for day-to-day activities and help stakeholders understand the organization's core business or activities.
    - Tangible and Actionable: Mission statements are often more concrete and actionable. They describe the specific products, services, or actions the organization undertakes to fulfill its purpose.
    - Short-Term and Immediate: While a mission statement can have long-term elements, it tends to be more focused on short-term and immediate goals and actions
    - Qustions to ask:
        - What are my short-term and long-term goals?
        - What are my core strengths and skills?
        - How do I want to approach challenges and setbacks? Determine your attitude and approach to adversity
        - What is my unique value proposition? Define how you can contribute to your work, community, or the world
        - What are my responsibilities and roles in life? Consider your roles as a parent, spouse, friend, employee, etc
- **Goals vs Mission: remember it while writing 1 year mission and goal: back**

\You can absolutely have both a 1-year mission statement and 1-year goals, and then break them down into 3-month goals. Having both a mission statement and specific goals for the same timeframe can be a powerful approach to guide your actions and maintain a sense of purpose. It doesn't have to be confusing if you use them effectively and understand their respective roles:

1-Year Mission Statement: Your 1-year mission statement provides the overarching theme or focus for the year. It sets the tone and direction, conveying the broader purpose or objective you want to work toward during that year. This statement helps you maintain a consistent and coherent approach to your goals.

1-Year Goals: Your 1-year goals are specific, measurable objectives that align with your mission statement. These goals break down the broader mission into actionable, concrete steps. Your goals should directly contribute to fulfilling your mission for the year. They provide a clear roadmap and measurable targets to track your progress.

3-Month Goals: Breaking your 1-year goals into 3-month goals helps you create a more detailed and manageable action plan. These shorter-term goals should be specific, time-bound, and directly connected to your 1-year goals. They provide a more immediate focus and enable you to make steady progress over time.

Having both a mission statement and specific goals for the same timeframe can help you maintain a balance between the big picture and the actionable steps needed to achieve it. The mission statement keeps you aligned with your broader purpose, while the goals provide the structure and clarity to your actions.

To avoid confusion, make sure your mission statement and goals are well-defined, written down, and regularly reviewed. Ensure that your 1-year goals are directly linked to your 1-year mission, and your 3-month goals align with your 1-year goals. This hierarchical structure should help you stay on track and motivated without creating confusion
