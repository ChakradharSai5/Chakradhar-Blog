Our guy bisoi is from ichhapuram near vizag i think, he is located at place where

very huge caste difference, there are many people in his locality working to higher caste as they have taken loan, and to resolve it they have to work for that person for say 20years.
He used to be non-Ex now became Ex coming to kaniha

He recently fought to resolve a caste assigning issue to his localities, he himself Bisoi joined NTPC in general category, but at his village many people did not have caste assigned to them due to some case in court due to which they are not able to apply job even in general, so he tried to fight for them, but what happened, some people among them actually fakd their caste and got jobs, so they themselves are not ready to support his fight, so he stopped his fight.

He joined in 2010 i think at korba later came here to kaniha at 2023 jan
