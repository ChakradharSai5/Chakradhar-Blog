	- As what amulya told
		- usually NPCIL, people are suppose to work like at single place for a long time, even whole service, we don't know if ntpc would continue that
		- and if tube leakages are too many, they simply decommission, so as far as possible, they simply run the unit at constant load, so as to avoid tube leakages
	- they are currently only 17 people in nuclear branch of ntpc, so director himself called amulya to confirm
	- he may get training at rawat nuclear plant, also called Rajastan atomic nuclear plant, which is located near rawatbhata.
