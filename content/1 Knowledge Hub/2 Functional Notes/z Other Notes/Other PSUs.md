- SAIL- mostly locations in north east, which is way underdeveloped so Denish said he don’t prefer going there,
- ONGC-15 days,
- Denish is from branch of industry something, which has managerial component so other PSUs don’t recruit in that
    - he gets to choose only some selected PSUs NTPC, ONGC, and SAIL, DVC, and few more.
    - In sept.2024 rajasthan state PSC exams shall be held, he is giving chance in that\
- IOCL and ONGC township is very bad- said by Hitesh
