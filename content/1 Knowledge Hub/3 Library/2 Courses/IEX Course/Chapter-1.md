## Chapter-1

### 1. Historical background

### **Initial State of Indian Electricity Sector (1947-1990s):**

- Installed capacity at independence: 1.4 GW
- Control by private companies, limited to major cities and industrial centers
- Formation of State Electricity Boards (SEBs) in the 1950s under Electricity Supply Act 1948
- SEBs managed generation, transmission, and distribution
- SEBs operated under State Energy Department, subject to state government decisions
- Notable growth in capacity and per capita consumption by 1990
- Installed capacity: 1.4 GW to 63.6 GW
- Per capita consumption: 16 kWh to 330 kWh
- Annual growth rate: 9% (installed capacity) and 7% (per capita consumption)
- Reason: Understanding the initial state and growth of the Indian electricity sector.

### **Challenges in the 1990s:**

- Operational inefficiencies and government interference in SEBs
- SEBs became loss-making entities
- Insufficient capital for capacity expansion
- Poor operational efficiency, high losses, inadequate tariffs
- Political pressures (e.g., free power to agriculture, cross-subsidization)
- Increasing dues from SEBs to Central Power Sector Undertakings (CPSUs)
- In 1975 NTPC formed
- Reason: Highlighting the challenges leading to the need for reforms.

### **Government Recommendations and Liberalization (1990s):**

- Suggestions aligned with Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) approach
- Privatization proposed as the solution to sector problems
- Similar LPG policies in other energy sectors
- Reform measures initiated and ongoing since the 1990s
- Reason: Introducing the government's approach and rationale for reforms.

### **Energy Deficit and Peak Deficit (1990s):**

- Energy deficit: 11.5%
- Peak deficit: 18%
- Unsustainable levels of deficits
- Reason: Emphasizing the urgency for reforms due to growing energy deficits.

### • The inefficiencies of SEBs

```
 (State Electricity Boards) were primarily attributed to:
```

- Unsatisfactory operational efficiencies, including poor availability of thermal plants.
- High transmission and distribution losses, exceeding normal technical standards, with a significant portion attributed to non-technical losses resulting from inadequate metering and energy theft.
- Inadequate billing and collection processes due to incorrect reporting, billing errors, insufficient collection efforts, meter tampering, and misreporting often in collaboration with consumers.
- Unmanageable size and monolithic structure of SEBs, resulting in unwieldiness, inefficiency, and resistance to change. Manpower issues such as poor productivity, low skills, insufficient training, and low motivation levels were also contributing factors.

### 2. Development of electricity market

### **Reforms introduced:**

- **Introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPP) Paradigm (1991)**
- In 1991, India initiated the first phase of power sector reforms with the introduction of the Independent Power Producers (IPP) paradigm.
- Reason: To attract investments for capacity addition.
- **Liberalization of Generation Business (1991)**
- In 1991, the generation business was liberalized, allowing private players, including foreign investors, to set up generating stations.
- Reason: Aligning with the liberalization-privatization-globalization (LPG) policies.
- **Mega Power Policy (1995)**
- Introduced fiscal incentives for generating stations with capacity greater than 1000 MW, including tax holidays, customs duty exemption, and hassle-free clearance.
- Reason: Encourage investment in large-scale power generation.
- **Common Minimum National Action Plan for Power (CMNAP) (1996)**
- Adoption of comprehensive reforms, including finalizing national energy policy, **establishing a central regulatory authority,** setting minimum tariffs for agricultural consumers, and promoting private participation in distribution and transmission.
- Reason: To address challenges and improve the power sector's overall performance.
- **Electricity Regulatory Commission Act (1998)**
- Passed in 1998, this act led to the **formation of independent regulatory commissions** responsible for tariff determination and utility performance monitoring.
- Reason: Reducing government interference and promoting commercial principles in tariff determination.
- **Structural Reforms in States (Late 1990s)**
- Supported by multilateral organizations like the World Bank and DfiD, some states like Odisha unbundled their vertically integrated State Electricity Boards (SEBs) into separate Generation, Transmission, and Distribution companies to enhance operational efficiency.
- Reason: Improve operational efficiency and serve as a model for power sector reforms.
- **Challenges Faced Despite Reforms**
- Challenges included inadequate capacity addition, poor operational efficiency, and financially unsustainable entities.
- Reason: Highlight the ongoing issues in the power sector.
- **Limited Capacity Addition by IPPs (1992-2002)**
- Despite IPP interest, only 6500 MW of capacity was added during the eighth and ninth five-year plans (1992-2002).
- Reason: Illustrate the gap between interest and actual capacity addition.
- **Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003)**
- A comprehensive and landmark legislation that replaced earlier acts, including the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity Supply Act 1948, and the ERC Act, 1998.
- Reason: Summarize the culmination of reforms efforts into a significant legislative framework.

### Other reforms

- In 1996, Odisha initiated comprehensive power sector reforms due to severe performance issues:
- Peak shortages: 37%
- Plant Load Factor (PLF): 29%
- Tariff: 71% of cost
- World Bank offered $995 million loan on condition of reforms, influenced by success in Latin American countries.
- **Reforms included:**
- Formation of Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) under OER Act.
- Restructuring of Odisha State Electricity Board (OSEB) into entities like Odisha Power Generation Corporation (OPGC) and Odisha Hydropower Corporation (OHPC).
- Privatization of four distribution utilities (CESCO, WESCO, NESCO, SOUTHCO) in 1999.
- GRIDCO's role in bulk power purchase and sale for Discoms.

### 2.2.Key initiatives

### Page-1

- By EA 2003, state and central govt. along with regulatory commissions took several initiatives,
- G business very amenable to competion so delicensed, only subject to safety, environmental, etc. standards to be met
- transmission distribution business being natural monopolies
    - **Restructuring of SEBs:**
        - G, T, D in vertical now were mandated to struturize them, suggested to make completely separate entities
    - **Independent Regulatory Commission**
        - CERC SERC under 1998 act all states mandated
        - Under EA act 2003 CERC functions:
            - Grid code
            - Tariff for Gen
            - Tariff for Txn
            - License for interstate Txn
            - To fix trading margins in interstate trading of electricity
            - To specify and enforces performance standards of licenses
            - To adjudicate any disputes between any entities
        - CERC also takes legislative role in making some policies
    - **Power procurement through competitive bidding:**
        - EA 2003 enabled this
        - IN 2005 govt. gave guidelines tariff bassed competetive bidding
        - Tariff policy 2006 mandated discoms that after 2011 any new power procueremnt through bidding
        - DBFOO model Design, Build, Finance, Own and Operate basis of Public Private Partnership for long (>=7yrs) and medium (1-7years)
        - This bidding very much helped capacity addition
        - In 2012 DEEP platform for short term basis(1 day to 1 year) and medium term managed by MSTC Ltd (Govt. enterprise)
    - **Open access to large C&I(commercial and industrial) consumers:**
        - CERC framed regulations for interstate Tx system
        - CTU(or PGCIL) and NLDC are nodal agencies
            - CTU for long and medium
            - NLDC for short term access
        - not only provide alternative avenue for the large commercial & industrial consumers
        - Also impel the Discoms to improve the efficiency to retain the consumers.
        - BUT Tariff and Non-Tariff barriers in Open Access:
            - T: additional charges levied on the buyers
                - Cross Subsidy Charges (CSS), Additional Surcharge (ASC)
                - Transmission charges, Wheeling charges etc
            - Non T: non-issuance of No Objection

Certificate, restrictions on minimum drawl of quantum and duration etc

- This restrictions vary from state to state bcs of SERCs
    - EX:

Andhra Pradesh state has specified an open access charge for ~Rs.

2.63/unit for the industrial consumers at 33 kV level. Similarly, Gujarat has made it mandatory

that a consumer has to take open access for a minimum period of 8 hours with less than 25%

load variation.

### Page-2

- **Introduction of Trading Licensees:**
    - Under EA 2003 act
    - Regulattions given in 2004
    - Trading =purchase of electricity for sale thereof.
        - Trading licensees are envisaged to facilitate transactions

between buyers and sellers by reducing the information gap and assuming market related risks

- viz. default risk,
- late payment risk,
- contract dishonour risk
- inflationary risks etc.
- for which they

are allowed to levy trading margins from the buyers

- Presently 43 trading licensees

playing the role of intermediaries in the electricity market.

- Ex: PTC, NVVN, JSW PTC, etc
- **Introducing PEXs:**
    - CERC guidelines in 2007 for establishing Power Exch, so PXIL and IEX were established.
    - Later CERC gave Power market regulations in 2010 - principles for PEXs
    - nationwide automated platform for

trading of electricity on short term basis.

- buy or sell electricity in a

competitive manner from an hour ahead basis to 90 days

- As participation in this increased,

increased both liquidity and efficiency of the trading platform

- CERC gave Power Market Regulations 2021
- A third power exchange namely Hindustan Power

Exchange (HPX) started in 2022

- **Independent system operations:**
    - EA 03 made NLDC, RLDC, & SLDC
        - At national, regional, and state level
    - For optimum scheduling and dispatch
    - National Electricity Policy 2005 emphsized on independent operations of NLDC, RLDC, SLDC

Apart (5 RLDCs are there)

from having a

- secure,
- reliable and
- efficient grid operations
- the independent system operations

has enabled

- participation of private transmission licensee under tariff based competitive bidding mechanism, allowed
    - non-discriminatory open access to the transmission system and
    - the development of competitive & efficient wholesale electricity
- GRID INDIA also established

### Side concepts-1
