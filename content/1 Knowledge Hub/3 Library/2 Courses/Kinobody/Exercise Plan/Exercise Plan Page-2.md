- - Perform 2-3 warm up sets for incline barbell bench press. A light set for 6 reps, a slightly heavier set for 4 reps and a slightly heavier set for 2 reps. The goal is to warm you up to your first work set without causing you fatigue.
- After the incline bench, you want to rest a few minutes then go into the flat dumbbell bench press. You are already warmed up so you can go straight into your set of 8-10 reps. Rest a few minutes, and drop the weight by roughly 10% then perform 10-12 reps
