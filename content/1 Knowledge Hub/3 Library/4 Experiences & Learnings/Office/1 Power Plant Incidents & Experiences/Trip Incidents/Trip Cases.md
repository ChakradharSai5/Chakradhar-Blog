- Max SP kept at 0Mw, so CV throttled as soon unit kept in CMC
    
    - MS Pr raised to 170ksc and so HPBP opened whch pressurised condensor and unit tripped on Vaccuum low
    - T trippped on Vac low
    - G tripped on T trip class B protection
- Immediately after synchrozation,
    
    block load SP became 0MW after 5sec genearator tripped on low forward power class-A protection T tripped on G tripping, reason is, with oil guns the BLI they kept less than some 10% which resulated in CV throttling
    
    - Actullay our total oil guns capacity is 30% BLI capacity with HFO, now since it is LDO , it might have still decreased, so by keeping as many guns as possible, we need to ensure that minimum 20% BLI before need to be ensured, as per OEM document
- Ph value < 8 means acidic
    
    - Somewhere boiler water Ph bacame 2, so literally acid entered into boiler
