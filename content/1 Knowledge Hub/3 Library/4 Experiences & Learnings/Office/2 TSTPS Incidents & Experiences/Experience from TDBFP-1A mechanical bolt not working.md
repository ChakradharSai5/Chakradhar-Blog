### **Experience from [[TDBFP]]-1A mechanical bolt not working

issue**

- TD-1A found tripping just around 2000rpm, after twice tripping in loaded condition, TMD recommended to do solo run and also along with it o/s run
- so both pumps decoupled and did solo run, in the solo run also tripping at around 2000rpm, so later identified that some problem with mechanical tripping device and so the oil going to it is completely isolated
- meanwhile due to multiple starting and stopping of turbine, the RTS got burnt and so C&I had to replace it.
- Later as TMD couldnâ€™t find the exact reason of tripping, they requested to completely isolate the oil going to mechanical bolt tripping device and so correspondingly to axial shift mechanical tripping and lub oil pr low mechanical tripping device.
- So they requested C&I to put electrical protection in axial shift at 085mm & also to reduce electrical o/s speed trip of turbine from 6134 to 5900rpm
    - The TD tripping is at 108% 6134, (100% 5680-rated speed of turbine)
    - and 110% 6248rpm mechanical tripping on bolt lifting
- Also they did soft locking at 5700rpm i.e, the command of speed would not go more than 5700rpm though you give whatever sp.
