### TDBFP isolation and Normalization
- Things to note is, as contrary to I though LP steam temperature permissive did not take much time, if all drains were also properly opened, especially MV valves at 8.5mtr.
	- actually of course why not, theoretically it should not take much time, as many people from long time, just being saying "it is like that from a long time", I also caught in that trap partially, and partially I don't have that much time to analyze it
- other thing is, main pump or booster pump vent that is connected to local drain pot at 17mtr, is just above suction valve 8.5mtr, causing when suction valve kept crack open, after filling when water started coming from vent that drain pot got severely overflow and started falling to 8.5mtr where a person was there opening suction, which could have been very unsafe incident, fortunately it did not, so need to be careful. 
	- so next time need to be careful while charging feedwater that, as soon water starts coming in pump vents, somebody should be continuously monitoring in in local to close the vent immediately
