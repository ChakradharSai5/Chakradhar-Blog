- I have done Unit-2 shutdown dated 21-06-2024
- During which what happened is, Kasi sir was there 
	- we took HBBP in manual, and I made it open to around 15%, he took unit in MW  control, decreased load SP to 200MW, yet load was maintaining around 250MW, and load was decreasing, by controlling HP CV (LPBP still in auto)
	- though load was around 230MW and was still in decreasing trend, as DSM doesn't support, unit made trip by Kasi sir by pressing EPB.
	- that's fine unit got tripped, and ok.
	- however mills' that were bypassed on steam flow less than 13% did not trip, as boiler trip to turbine trip is also bypassed, so it was made stop manually
	- I manually stopped PA fans, by making blade pitch zero, step by step
	- we heard severe screeching sound, I was told by all, that it is because of partial vacuum clearing, some shit I don't clearly know
	- later when MS Pressure was maintaining above 100ksc I guess, suddenly we heard another heavy sound, every one shouting what happened
		- I was HPCV full open, LPCV I'm not sure, I think got full open
		- yet CRH and HRH pressure went upto 55ksc, and safety valve floating, we concluded immediately that safety got floated,
		- but why, then I saw LPBP found trip means LPBP SV got closed.
		- so I did reset it - twice, it did not open,
		- then I did LPBP trip, and then reset, then it opened, and then we took both HPCV and LPCV in manual adjusted accordingly to decrease pressure of CRH and HRH
	- Later after S panel checking by BMD, 3 oil guns taken O/s in level-1,(taken at start of S/d).
	- MFT done, by pressing EPB and then, FW 71 closed and then  FW decreased to 300Tph, kept for 30mins around after Unit trip

### After shutdown things
?
- Refractory shall be removed when BMD opens the boiler manhole door to put sky climber while attending boiler tube leakage
- this refractory is again will be patched or built after attending the leakage, while removing sky climber parallelly
- need the know the need of removal and how exactly it is
