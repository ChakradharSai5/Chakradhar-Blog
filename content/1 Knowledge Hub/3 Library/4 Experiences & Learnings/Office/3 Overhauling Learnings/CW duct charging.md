- [[CW]] duct charging down one side from CW blow down I think Hot CW duct, ICV 1 and ICV 2 CW cold duct charging
    - Now Pass-B Inlt and O/L valves slightly opened to 40%

### CW Duct

- CW inlet duct draining gets over by starting itself in may be 1 day
- CW outlet duct draining done takes about 6 days

### Random

â€¢ TD-B catridge is going to get replaced

- Main TG barring gets stopped roughly on 6thday
- While aligning rotar JOP will be started and stopped and rotor rotated slowly by aux barring motor and alignment will be done
- Bearing 2 has speed probes, I think 3 seen while overhauling
### Random learnings

- Before start of overhauling
    - All welding DB, and AC MLDB switchgear OH PTW will be taken by EMD, as same cannot be done during overhauling
        - There is something
    - Also insulation survey will be done by I think EEMD, (not sure), to identify in boiler where insulation required.
    - TDBFPs solo run will be done while stopping the unit
