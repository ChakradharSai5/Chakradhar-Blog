### Rule 1
- Place a Note in such a place where, if you want to look for that particular concept later, where would you look for it, where do your mind says "ok may be you'll find it here" 
- So that place where you place your concept should be intuitively guessable
### Rule 2
- Folders should be uniquely different, it should not be clubbable one folder should be unique to other
### Rule 3
- Understand Source Vs concept note
	- All the notes that I have here is mostly concept notes, but only except the notes in Library, they are as I call them source notes, which means those notes are made with categorization of source, some notes of this might be linked to concept notes 
### Rule 4 
- Any concept Note should be simple and clear, it should NOT be unclear, if it is not clear yet, just add tag:  # pending, so that later after getting clarity you can edit the same and make the note clear, clear??
