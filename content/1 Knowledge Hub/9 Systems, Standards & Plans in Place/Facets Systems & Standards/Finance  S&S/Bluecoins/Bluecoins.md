### Bluecoins Synch System
It works in three levels
- When you do Quick Synch - while close open or when you manually press quick synch - it shall modify a single file in 
	- Google drive---->Bluecoins Folder----->Quicksynch ---> Blucoins.fydb
	- and there's another tracker file, along with fydb file to store meta data I think
- Another from this local backup is set at daily 23:30PM to folder
	- Internal storage---->Bluecoins--->Backups folder
    1. Apart from this, if you press "back up to Google drive" in "Online Synch" options in bluecoins setting then a fresh back up file shall gets created inside bluecoins folder of Google drive (Beside Quick synch folder)
