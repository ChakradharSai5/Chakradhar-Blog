### Bluecoins
It works in three levels
    1. When you do Quick Synch - while close open or when you manually press quick synch - it shall modify a single file in Google drive---->Bluecoins Folder----->Quicksynch ---> Blucoins.fydb, and another tracker file to store meta data I think
    2. Another from this local backup is set at daily 23:30PM to folder Internal storage---->Bluecoins--->Backups folder
    3. Apart from this, if you press "back up to Google drive" in "Online Synch" options in bluecoins setting then a fresh back up file shall gets created inside bluecoins folder of Google drive (Beside Quick synch folder)
