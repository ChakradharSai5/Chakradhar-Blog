- I think this is most planned way I went to home ever, because by that I got my Task Management system partially done.
- and also through making that, and leading active social life, and slightly good healthly life,
	- Consequent to all this, I gained some confidance, and had certain partial clarity on money spending, and certian clarity on social interaction,
	- certain clarity and confidence with sravya, all caused a good intentional time at chandragiri and tiruapati
- The main reason for going is for Annaprasana for Siva, but it is very small occasion, and was done in 10 mins.
--- 
Major things I did at Tirupati is
- Helped sravya to organize her room
- Took sravya's interview
- Took ammama's partial interview
- Spend partial good time without quarells with sravya, went to walk at park
- I felt like I am at higher level than sravya, to guide sravya, not that I want it to be that way, but I just don't like myself being the other way
- Took siva to chandragiri and nagaihagari palli
- Installed spotify for attha, mama, amma, nanna, pinni, sunil mama

Overall it felt good and intentioanal,, but definetly could be more like i should have done more, like bsnl sim work, and complete ammama interview and could have not shouted on dad, while at prasanthi nagar

I guess intentional life is what makes us keeps happy and content
