1. **Did you do as planned to do, if not just what stopped you and remember to solve it by doing something-any idea pops send it to Varma**

> Just only 11% done. that is 12 Things, Fucking hell!! (in Butcher tone)
And CLARITY ON PARTIALLY KNOWN THING - CAREER - 2.3%
First level of home organizing - GENERIC 25%
To apply medical claims - GENERIC 0
To have digital life structured and organized - GENERIC 28%
To make Personal Finance dashboard with last year review notes and running year plan - Finances - 0%
And from calendar it is clearly shown that in two rotas, in first rota I did something on evening shifts, in second rota, did nothing, no things are done during second rota or fortnight.
The solution is simple: STICK TO ROUTINE and do things FAST, because I mostly did not do, because I did not plan that day morning, which I suppose to do as part of my routine. so yeah that's the solution.
