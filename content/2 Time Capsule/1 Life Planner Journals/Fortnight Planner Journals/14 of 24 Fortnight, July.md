1. **Did you do as planned to do, if not just what stopped you and remember to solve it by doing something-any idea pops send it to Varma**

> ANS: Did only 14.6% of planned things, and that too next fortnight planning on 10th of august, quite late.
> No problem, I worked on Quartz blog making system thorough - an unplanned project, refer [[Chakradhar-Blog Making]] 
> While doing this project, all this shit, I faced ankle sprain, almost a fracture on 19th July I guess, so I had to go to hospital and meanwhile, had to sort & apply medical claims and apply it, and had to take care of Siva, and Sravya and have to follow routines, cannot miss like health app noting , sleep noting and bluecoins &  many people coming home like Kishore and some hiccups in plans like, photos ordered for Pinni, misdelivered, so had to return and place order again, daily morning routine of sorting home, organizing, clearing pending place. it was quite hectic, now that I think back, I did pretty well, and Sravya helped me pretty well, I never thought I could DO this much work
> Also had to stream line the book reading or youtube learning and any learning from a source, so partially did that project also.
> Did scooty repair, and applied medical claim, that's a major task cleared, Thank god.

- [x] Problems mentioned above solutions informed Varma
