- [x] Keep this one side, and keep Fortnight planner page in notion side by side

1. **What do you want to do in this particular Fortnight??**
> ANS: Main thing I want to do is create a proper planning simple clear workflow at least to the extent that keeps my routine intact - so that I can create remaining workflow later in time slowly, so that I can be tense free while doing Tasks, watching movie or reading a book, or spending time with friends and family.


# Fortnight End Notes

- [x] Keep this one side, and keep Fortnight planner page in notion side by side

1. **Did you do as planned to do, if not just what stopped you and remember to solve it by doing something-any idea pops send it to Varma**

> ANS: No, but I definably got improved drastically because, I got attend light up and shut down activities, so my career exposure got improved drastically and this affected my confidence heavily, and I got into book reading, thatâ€™s a good thing, only thing that bugs me is clarity of partially known things- Project. That and food I have to make, this is something i most defiantly could have done better, and messed up, but one thing kind of proud of myself is due to this whole organized thing, I am getting very less anger issues on sravya, or any other. Also socially I have become active, and made this whole planner thing, took me lot of brainstorm. One thing is for sure, now I am feeling that, even if I show this to someone, like all this things of organized things, like bluecoins, ET money plan, notion, obsidian(yet to build), I am sure, it is very difficult for them to build, so I am actually open to show them, in fact I showed and explained this bluecoins thing to prudhvi, felt little proud of myself, that I have stick to something for such a long period of time. Same thing I should apply to career, health, and relationships also, to be consistent and work hard on it. Done 66 tasks, out of which 24 are career project- partially known things. overall satisfied with what I did, as definitely improvement is there. only as much as I wanted or planned
