1. **What do you want to do in this particular Fortnight??**
> ANS: Major projects I want to focus this Fortnight is, career project- clarity on those partially known things, second to make a system for note taking, making processing, a personal Knowledge management system- to stream line those things in parallel with task management system- TMS. another thing I want to focus is organize home to the extent of at least kitchen, hall, study room and bedroom so that i feel like reading in bedroom and hall. so that I can enjoy any media or things consumption And lastly, as soon I get first two things almost 70% completed, Iâ€™d start MBA preparation plan to be done. and write an exam of MBA first, and see what happens then

1. **Did you do as planned to do, if not just what stopped you and remember to solve it by doing something-any idea pops send it to Varma**

> ANS: One important thing is though I have cleared around 69% of planned fortnight tasks, I did not complete major things that I thought to complete - from what I wrote at fortnight start, one because I have "done" many tasks that are very silly so simply cleared them, and second because some things are repetitive so I cleared them. What I have come to know by seeing that I am focusing my energy at wrong areas, atleast not the areas I want to. Also so much time went into other major unplanned things like watching movies with ashok, srikanth and sai kiran. but thats absolutely fine as you know my phil -[[Time with friends]]
