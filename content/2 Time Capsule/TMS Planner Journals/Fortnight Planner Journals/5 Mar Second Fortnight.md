# Fortnight End Notes

- [x] Keep this one side, and keep Fortnight planner page in notion side by side

1. **Did you do as planned to do, if not just what stopped you and remember to solve it by doing something-any idea pops send it to Varma**

> ANS: Actually, went partially planned, as projects of notion completed upto 77%, apart from that, organized home to very greater extent, thrown away lot of things in that process.
>  And mentally, I am at a much stable state I can say, because of this tensionless that tomorrow I don't miss any tasks as I have this TMS, is assuring. And any new thing learnt or being learnt is being sent to Varma, for later proper research.
>  Only thing that I literally HATE myself, currently is 3 things
> 	 1. Not going GYM
> 	 2. Not having proper Food -Good protein rich and vegetables
> 	 3. MBA preparation
> These are the things I should work on, these Fortnight, and because of this I am not getting mood to read any books also.
> Socially definetely improved, I am getting slightly more confidant that I can speak with anybody. went to raghob home twice I guess. Prudhvi, Aditya & Myself had beer and talk. Talking with SCE and ASCE slightly more frankly. Talking with juniors also more candidly, but also had some moments of embarassing, regret of acting like an idiot, like scaring ammulu at holi, talking kind of excited at prudhvi, aditya party. Talking stupid sometimes with Sravya, These are the areas I should work on, by being more concious of being honest and not talk or behave lighly, think well before doing or talking any.
> That's it
> Also did organize home well, bedroom, hall, fridge room almost set, only remainting thing also need to be sort and set, this also comes under base, as mentioned in  [[Definitions]] rules, this is something that need to be completed asap
>
