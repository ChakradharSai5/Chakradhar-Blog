- It was quite challenging, as it was totally unknown thing, I had to read articles and watch YouTube, and  run some complicated commands to make the blog take data from system and can be accessed in web
- then came another problem, how to merge this with already synch system I made for phone and tablet, that was a challenge, and I came up with a long term solution of having two folders - one as Vault in obsidian, and another as Folder in Chakradhar-Blog Folder for access to web, and there was a challenge to try to find a software that synchs both these folders, and after finding that software, how to make it work with least amount of effort as it is required to be done frequently as I want almost daily sync with my blog, all these are challenges we have faced and overcome
- another challenge came with excalidraw drawing, as there is no rendering of excalidraw code in quartz software, it won't display excalidraw drawings in blog, so I had to workaround, searched the settings to get image file of excalidraw, and to streamline this to make it work for long-run, had to find an easy and intuitive way, like make the setting  on auto creating SVG file beside excalidraw drawing, every time we create excalidraw, SVG file gets created, but it HAS to be in note to make it display in blog, so had to find a way to do it, refer [[Github Synch S&S]]
- And next challenge came with embedding files - pdfs and images, oh boy!! that was very frustrating, as earlier I was using Imgur plugin, and that stores  as said in [[Obsidian Plugins and Synch learnings]], I had to figure out how to store images & pdfs, I thought at least for images, I can do away with plugin called Google photos, as said in [[Obsidian Plugins and Synch learnings]], but that created huge problem of having to see only thumbnail both in obsidian and in blog, and just to setup this plugin, I had to learn about google console project and create some ID and secret key and stuff as said in [[Obsidian Plugins and Synch learnings]], that was quite challenging & frustrating, as only thumbnail, and not easy to attach the image (had to first upload image in google photos and then pick it from there), I had to leave that
- then after doing some reasearch found that github is actually a microsoft owned and we can store up to 100GB, I decided go with storing direcly the images by drag & drop - intuitive and easy.
- Then about pdfs, this also was challenging, I realized there was a techinque with iframe code to webaccess pdfs that were in google drive or one drive, thought of doing that, but then upon experincing I realized this way is quite cubersome and even after that cubersome task, the way pdf get's accessed is quite slow and sometimes causing glitch error
	- so after mutliple trial and error and learning, I have decided to go with storing pdfs also the same way I store images, good thing is Github repository stores pdfs and make them also accesbale in blog, 
- After having mind map of all this, to restructe my whole obsidian notes based with this is quite a cubersome, hectic task and took so much time and sleep :-(
