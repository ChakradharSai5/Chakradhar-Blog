Based on your notes, when a unit trips, you should first analyze the specific reason for the trip. Some common causes mentioned in your notes include low vacuum, low forward power, and acidic pH levels in the boiler water. It is important to identify the root cause of the trip to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, follow the appropriate procedures for resetting the unit and ensuring all safety precautions are in place before restarting the unit. If necessary, consult with authorized personnel to address any technical issues that may have led to the trip.
