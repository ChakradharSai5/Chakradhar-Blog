Based on your notes, the dew point is the temperature at which a gas reaches a state of saturation with moisture, causing excess moisture to condense onto surfaces as tiny liquid droplets. It is important in applications like cooling hydrogen in generators, where maintaining a specific dew point temperature is crucial to prevent condensation on contact surfaces. Calculating the dew point requires pressure, temperature, and moisture content information.
