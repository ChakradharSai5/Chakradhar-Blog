Here is the Fortnight Planner Journals note for the month of February:
### 3 Feb Second Fortnight
#### Fortnight Start Notes
- Main thing I want to do is create a proper planning simple clear workflow at least to the extent that keeps my routine intact - so that I can create remaining workflow later in time slowly, so that I can be tense free while doing Tasks, watching movie or reading a book, or spending time with friends and family.
#### Fortnight End Notes
- No, but I definably got improved drastically because, I got attend light up and shut down activities, so my career exposure got improved drastically and this affected my confidence heavily, and I got into book reading, that’s a good thing, only thing that bugs me is clarity of partially known things- Project. That and food I have to make, this is something I most definitely could have done better, and messed up, but one thing kind of proud of myself is due to this whole organized thing, I am getting very less anger issues on Sravya, or any other. Also socially I have become active, and made this whole planner thing, took me a lot of brainstorm. One thing is for sure, now I am feeling that, even if I show this to someone, like all these things of organized things, like bluecoins, ET money plan, notion, obsidian(yet to build), I am sure, it is very difficult for them to build, so I am actually open to show them, in fact I showed and explained this bluecoins thing to Prudhvi, felt a little proud of myself, that I have stuck to something for such a long period of time. Same thing I should apply to career, health, and relationships also, to be consistent and work hard on it. Done 66 tasks, out of which 24 are career project- partially known things. Overall satisfied with what I did, as definitely improvement is there, only as much as I wanted or planned.
This is the information from the Fortnight Planner Journals note for the second fortnight of February.
