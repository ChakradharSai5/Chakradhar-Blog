Prudhvi, Aditya & Myself had beer and talk. Talking with SCE and ASCE slightly more frankly. Talking with juniors also more candidly, but also had some moments of embarassing, regret of acting like an idiot, like scaring ammulu at holi, talking kind of excited at prudhvi, aditya party. Talking stupid sometimes with Sravya, These are the areas I should work on, by being more concious of being honest and not talk or behave lighly, think well before doing or talking any.\n> That's it\n> Also did organize home well, bedroom, hall, fridge room almost set, only remainting thing also need to be sort and set, this also comes under base, as mentioned in  [[Definitions]] rules, this is something that need to be completed asap","hypothetical_3":"2 Time Capsule/TMS Planner Journals/Fortnight Planner Journals/3 Feb Second Fortnight.md > Fortnight End Notes\n\n1. **Did you do as planned to do, if not just what stopped you and remember to solve it by doing something-any idea pops send it to Varma**\n\n> ANS: No, but I definably got improved drastically because, I got attend light up and shut down activities, so my career exposure got improved drastically and this affected my confidence heavily, and I got into book reading, thatâ€™s a good thing, only thing that bugs me is clarity of partially known things- Project. That and food I have to make, this is something i most defiantly could have done better, and messed up, but one thing kind of proud of myself is due to this whole organized thing, I am getting very less anger issues on sravya, or any other. Also socially I have become active, and made this whole planner thing, took me lot of brainstorm. One thing is for sure, now I am feeling that, even if I show this to someone, like all this things of organized things, like bluecoins, ET money plan, notion, obsidian(yet to build), I am sure, it is very difficult for them to build, so I am actually open to show them, in fact I showed and explained this bluecoins thing to prudhvi, felt little proud of myself, that I have stick to something for such a long period of time. Same thing I should apply to career, health, and relationships also, to be consistent and work hard on it. Done 66 tasks, out of which 24 are career project- partially known things. overall satisfied with what I did, as definitely improvement is there. only as much as I wanted or planned"}
