# Rough notes

- THE BOYS
    - The main idea behind such an engaging story is as said by the director in an interview
        - Working more on character
        - and how to present that in a most surprising way
- In the TV show Mirzapur, the characters often communicate in a realistic and natural way, rather than using exaggerated or artificial dialogue. For example, when Maqbool's mother is mistakenly killed by Munna, Kaleen Bhayya doesn't apologize or express remorse in a conventional way. Instead, he tries to deflect responsibility by saying something like "a bullet doesn't ask who to kill when it leaves the gun." Similarly, other characters in the show often use philosophical or symbolic language to express their thoughts and feelings, rather than stating things directly. This helps to create a realistic and immersive atmosphere in the show.
- - Recently I have watched, X-men apocalypse movie in that therer is a scene in the start of the movie where magneto hiding in Russia talks to his daughter, as I decode it, my observations:
        - They want to establish a peaceful, stable life that magneto is having with his family.
        - the way they do that is, they want to show how much magneto loves his famly, there is a scene, they want to him to say that he loves his daughter very much.
        - The scene goes like, he sings a song, daugheter asks, where did he learn this song, he says he learnt it from his faterh & mother,. And importantly he CONTINUES to saythat his mother and father learnt from his their mother and father & and their from their. and so on.
        - daughter asks what happened to them, he says, they were taken from him, she asks, will he also will be taken from him, he says “No one can ever take her from him” the scene ends there.
        - This is very good example of how they are approaching the scene.
        - They want something,-like an emotion, and for that they go back trace on how it is suppose to be to get that scene.
- - A personally like fantasy, or scifi more I think is because, it gives very clear opportunity to do new narration, which would both surprise and also unpredictable. regular all other movies which usually revolves around same kind of concept, it is very difficult for them to come up with new narration, and so becomes predictable, and so it mostly might not generate same emotion in me.
    - Only when it is fresh idea story, and with a interesting, unpredictable surprising narration, can a story becomes interesting.
    - When sotry is fresh one, it gives huge margin for director to go with new narration.
    - If story is not fresh, it becomes difficult for director to do new fresh narration, and also to keep audience engaging.
- - Another best example is Tumbaad:
    - In tumbaad it is very difficult ot predict, first of all, to what is going to happen, where will this will end, because the story is very new and fresh idea.
    - and now the second thing, being the way I see it, director liked the idea of creating very engaging scene of hero getting reveled to get money, then he gets greedy with his son to get more money and so when it is reveled that we will get more hasthar, the horror feeling that idea or emotion is what makes director to get kick. but to get to that point organically you gotta let them invest in all the story, and along with that you have to make them genuinely understand all the limatations and other things
    - Now THE DIFFERENCE between good story idea and good story idea with narration, si between TUMBAAD and VIRUPAKSHA, both I believe have very good ideas, very engaging ideas, but while implementing that is the narration part I think tumbaad very much exceeded virupaksha, and so not only the story engaging in tumbaad, you feel like it is rewathable
    - I think tumbaad comes with good narration because I feel it worked more on characters, and scenes, so much so that it feels very much organic that it actually feels all characters are doing what they do , and there is no other way the story could have gone. that is the only way the story could have happened. because the charactes are who they are.
    - Another thing that I want to do:
    - I start to notice that drama is more important, more than logical thrilling elements.
    - The way I wan to go with my story telling is, I want to more drama, keep audience under drama engaged to the character emotions and situations making them go through something.
    - But in the end that should go end in a logical thriller.
    - I think the best movies always turn out to be this kind of ones.
    - you see edge of tomorrow- we engage ourselves with love of our tom with Emily blunt, but actual thrilling element, thrills us, This drama also very much helpful in engaging audience in movie and so easy to not let them see what’s about to come
    - SO even this movie, the time loop one, I want it to be more about his flaw of not sharing his problem with his wife, and not about logical thing that is making him go in loop. What ever he’s doing, or talking it should be out of some emotion, not out of logic.
- - Learning: One way to create a realistic and immersive atmosphere in a TV show or film is to have the characters communicate in a natural and realistic way, using philosophical or symbolic language rather than conventional or exaggerated dialogue.
- - In movie wolverine origins, villain shows up to wolverine when he wakes up after his brother killing his wife,
    - Our hero naturally theretens him, saying it is because of him,
- - Movie :Kids of the dragon
    - Idea of tension moment ,comes with audience knowing something and villain /somebody don't know that thing and we /audience fear they may find ,and the more time you take ,the more audiences get tense ,and the more you get audience invested in the characte
    - Character that is interacting with villain /the more audience get tense. Scene of heroine interacting with villain in second half of movie kiss of the dragon
