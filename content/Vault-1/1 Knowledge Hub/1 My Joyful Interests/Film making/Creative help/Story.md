- While watching Forgotten korean movie I realized, when the climax is about to come, I realized both heros has to die, then only I will get satisfaction, otherwise IF the story would have other way, where they live, I am sure I would have not liked it, So I have this feeling of story should be certain way only then it will be good, I think I should go with that while making a story myself.
- And I realized I also want my memoryloss story to be like that something sad, a feeling that it's no one's fault, shit happens- I'm still exploring this
- Voice over can be properly used, esp. when unreliable narration
- Nolan tell that story telling should be like mystery revealing,
    - It should be like mystery unfolding, you don't want to let audience to understand everything from the start, otherwise there is nothing to unfold
    - Also shouldn't be too ahead of audience, they'll lose interest
