.

**Script**

Scene-1:

He is standing leaning on to car having a cigirrate, gets a call from her, he won’t pick. Also doesn’t cut the call

HIS CHARACTER

He is a strong person, who have mostly no insecurities, believes life is how it is, you have to make the best of what god has given to you. He is educated enough to know that what diagnosed is corrcet. He really believes that he has a disease, that makes him see somebody as killing him. Yet his usual immediate response is acting on what he sees, and he hates himself for doing that.

His main insecurity lies not seeking help, he believes if he is supposed to take care of himself, He shouldn’t ask for anyone’s help. He is supposed to provide the family. He is supposed to take care of himself. He sends money regularly asks about their health. He dosen’t share his problems, asks theier problems and tries to give solutions. He thinks everything has a solution. There is no point in worrying too much about them. He wants to take care of his family. He believes keeping life organized helps to become better. He works hard for money, and he wants money to provide all needs for his family.

His flaw also he believes its ok if for providing them he can be not honest. He tries to evade, He don’t want to lie, so he lies as little as possible.

He Just dosen’t listen/ he dosen’t care when the other asks about his problems   when the other says/asks to share problems, he goes his own world of telling them what they should do solve their problems

And so other since being weak like normal human being, goes to explain why she could ‘nt do it, or why she can’t do it, or kind of like “it makes sense so I will try”, Go with the flow, dosen’t identify that he is trying to evade to talk about his problems, **until last minute,** she realizes that once in a while and asks him not to do it.

IDEA:

When he finally gets a chance to change, if he changes he can come out of loop by lifting phone or something by telling her his real problem, he dosen’t share, he will always lie there and suffer. His character arc is to overcome and accept that he is vulnerable too. Its ok to share his problem, he has to realize the fact that by not sharing his problem he is making his problem even bigger.

He gets to situation where he has to make a choice whether share his probem or not. In screen we will show him touching his phone for making call/ Him pressing buttons for sending message if he is able to do that he can come out of loop other wise he will be living life the same as we have seen the loop

Last shot- camera goes up, from top view, camera rotating and the cell phone call being lifted she’s asking what happened why did he call, CUT to credits

**I JUST REALIZED THE WAY HOW TO FIND THE STORY:**

First I think I should find a idea of a story that passionates me, after finding that idea, when I visit that particular idea or scene in that movie, that excites me.(This is story)

Now back trace from there, what makes that scene that really excites, and how situations/characters should be to reach that point, - ,( This is narration of story)

Study deep on characters because that’s what really exciting.

Make situations and instances and characters as organic as possible.

And now in the narration of story make the scenes and situtations – be organic and also engaging-

Like leave a question to be answred

Keep somebody on stakes

Do different screenplay

Etc

Do anything to keep audience engaged, but keep in organic and unpredictable.

HOW I WANT  MY STORY TO BE:

Here what I have is the scene where audinence should feel like – arey he should have taken her help, why is he so idiotic in taking help, OH also he is stuck in loop, Oh so he is the person who’s writing letters to himself, Because of himself those things happened which led to him thinking that somebody is killing him, ofcourse anyone would think that, because I myself thought of it, WOW that is some fucked up shit

I will write draft of script, for each round of writing complete script, I should get this above mentioned high- more and more – only then I am going in right direction

I want the story to be more about drama, character actions and talks should result from how his emotional state rather than what he logically will do like a robot with the information he has.

Even the bgm also reflect his emotional state rather than thrilling music like for a thriller

The narration scene goal should be how to make that ending scene where it is revealed that he is on a loop more “Oh fuck!” for the audience.

**SCRIPT**

**Outline:**

**A person get to know that he has a disease that makes him see things that are not real, especially a person, he is not sure whether that person is real. Before he could process this thing, he has to tell this to girlfriend (both are mature enough- working in software meeting ends, about to get married, both their parents know about it), but he don’t want to tell to her, as he thinks taking help is weak, he also feels guilty for getting this disease, also don’t want to burden her thinking about his problem- flaw. He thinks he’ll figure it out himself.**

(s.s 1 - he tries to hide it from her, saying its nothing, but she tells him doctor already called her and told her about his disease, he confronts him why is he not telling the truth to her, he says he didn’t lie, he just didn’t feel like sharing it with her, she asks yelling why, he tells idk, may be…..---while talking he turns away from road, we too turn away from road- when turns back to road, he sees that person he imagines- a unforeseen sudden shock to audience – our guys tries to evade by turning steering suddenly, screen blank- sound of accident)

(s.s2 - he tries to hide it from her, saying its nothing, but she tells him doctor already called her and told her about his disease, he confronts him why is he not telling the truth to her, he says he didn’t lie, he just didn’t feel like sharing it with her, she asks yelling why, he tells idk, why do make such big things about every small things, she asks is this a small thing--- while talking he turns away from road, we too turn away from road- when turns back to road, he sees that person he imagines- a unforeseen sudden shock to audience – our guys tries to evade by turning steering suddenly, screen blank- sound of accident)

(s.s3- he tries to hide it from her, saying its nothing, but she tells him doctor already called her and told her about his disease, he confronts him why is he not telling the truth to her, he says he didn’t lie, he just didn’t feel like sharing it with her, she asks yelling why, he tells idk, I really don’t know, I’m sorry, from next time I’ll tell you, she says you always tell this, but you never tell me, he tries to tell , but stops, stays silent, she says- ok get tablets while coming home, it’s just one month, he says- yeah, sare kani, --he has to say something that shows love towards her like he bought a gift, or he’s getting something for her etc.—while talking he turns away from road, we too turn away from road- when turns back to road, he sees that person he imagines- a unforeseen sudden shock to audience – our guys tries to evade by turning steering suddenly, screen blank- sound of accident)

**But before he figures it out, he meets with an accident.**

**He wakes up in a house, him waking up with water slowly flowing on floor to his face.**

(ss1 shot opens from black to fade in to his face proper closeup shot camera going back rotating sideways to reveal him sleeping on floor- slowly waking up-under a bed- as he wakeup he hits head to bottom of cot really hard)

**He gets confused as to where is he, what he is doing there. He comes to know from the things he kept for himself, due to accident he lost ability to make new memories, everytime he sleeps he loses memory of that day. But this is very much temporary if he uses medicines properly for few weeks.  And it is revealed that he didn’t tell at home about this, takes leave in office and said onsite tour for two weeks and staying alone. Eating and sleeping that’s all.**

**Now after knowing this he thinks ok, and cleans the water in home,**

**Finds a medical bottle on sofa, takes it, keeps it in rack, starts doing normal chores. makes some food and eats, something gets delivered and he recieves. Takes tablet after meal. There is sticker notes that says take this after meal.**

(He finds no vegetables at home, and which are already found over)

(bell rings and he goes nobody will be there, again bell rings, again he goes scolding he sees something on floor, he gets it)

**He gets a call from his love, satya, asking where he is, he simply lies that he is on tour very busy, while talking to her he order something in amazon pantry. She asks did he check his phone in repair shop, he asks why, it is revelead thorugh conversation between them that she is getting call from his phone daily evening, and when she lifts no one answers and when she calls back no body lifts. He starts getting suspicious, he says some usual reason and she says daily you are saying same thing.**

**Then it is also revealed that it has been already 3 weeks and he hasn’t returned through her conversation. He gets even more suspicious and tries to get any more information on anything else he had to know.**

**But she don’t know anything and you don’t share much. Ok come as soon as possible.**

**But he gets suspicious looks around and he finds some more things that confirms his suspicious that somebody is actually messing with him.**

**He searches for his medical report, and finds that the accident happened 10 weeks ago, and he gets panick.**

**So to face it, he thinks it is better to write something and searches for notepad and finds notepad as soon as he opens drawer, hastily he writes something that somebody looking to kill him or messing with him. He finds it wrong, so he tears it and throw it to dust bin. It is shown to audience that there are many papers already in the dust bin.** (there is a scene that must be kept after revealing to audience that there are many papers in dust bin, to interestingly drag)

**Then it is revealed to him also that there are many papers in dust bin, it is 100% believed that somebody is messing with him, but for what?**

**He gets mental, he tries to open window and see, he searches thorugh out the apartment taking a knife in hand. But no one will be there, but things are in such a way that there is somebody other than him**

**Now finally he thinks it is better to get out of house, but he is starting to get really sleepy, he starts searching for key, through out the house, while searching he gets a nail hit to his hand, he makes a medical bottle to fall on floor(the one he took after meal) causing some blood to drop.**

**He thought to call her, almost dails about to ring, but he won’t.** (we should clearly & make audience believe that he is actually going to do call her- this is crucial as audience should red herring every possible way, they should not at at all see what’s coming)

**But he continues to search and then finally he finds the key under the sofa, there he sees a medical bottle that he recongnises to be the bottle from medical report, where doctor mentioned to take for remedy, it is revealed the one he is taking is sleeping tablets**(there are two ways we can go here, from the start there is a bottle on rack and he is taking it without knowing it is not the one he has to take-and that is a sleeping pill,  the other way is while he is searching house for key he mistakenly drops the medical bottle-sleeping bottle and in the start of movie when he wakes up, he sees this bottle and takes it and keeps it the place that this actual bottle should be, there is also another way, where he wakes up sees the actual bottle as it is almost touching his hand, takes it keeps it on the table(not so clearly intentionally shown) and while searching for key he mistakenly makes the bottle to fall and roll to this place where it is now)

**Now seeing this he gets to understand something and he realizes something, clearly shown to audience before audience can piece it together, but as he is getting really sleepy he falls on floor but tries to take the tablet, so he takes phone and tries to call her, he almost calls her, but it it’s too late he went to sleep, she picks and says hello, hello chakri, , cuts away to things that are left, dust bin, window , tap, his face slowly zooms out to fade out.**

(this should be reverse of cut in shot of what we did in the starting)
