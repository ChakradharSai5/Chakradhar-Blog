- Main rich areas are Seethamma dhaara
	- MNVP junction #pending 
	- Birla junction- which is near to Kishore's and Divya's home
- Near Divya and Kishore home there is dhaara called Maadhavadhaara - the place is kind of ok, peaceful to sit and relax, where there is a dhaara coming from the mountain, we don't from where the water starts from
	- Their family actually considers this dhaara sacred and so before starting a big ceremony- they take water from here and do somthing with it
- NAD flyover junciton- NAD- National Armament Depot
	- from there simhachalam is also very near around 20-30 mins
	- near this place aonly kishore has a land i think 75 gajalu 
- Near to here an airport construcion is under going, in the route from vizag to railway station to bhogapuram, called bhogapuram international airport, which is near to ashok sir's home, ashok sir's home is near to both railway station and the airport construciton that is being done
- I think #ClarityLess  this NAD juntion to simhachalam route where kishore has land is the route that goes to airport, and so as kishore's saying that road becomes main road that connects sea port to airport, he said that is how all world big cities got developed- got to know more about this about world thing and about vizag specific #pending  [[Kishore & Divya]]
- Big drawing of Vizag map  to be made, as said by [[Vinodh NTPC]]
	- Map include- bhemmili which is at one end of vizag, and rishikonda is at the follow along road of beach road, which makes to road to geetham college i think, then there is a building, jagan built for his mps as an officil, incase vizag becomes capital, then there's a temple made by big company
	- there's a place near to beach towards other side of bheemili route, where muslim christians and hindus lived, there vinodh used to live, later he moved a place near seethamma dhaara
