# Love and parenting

- I think mostly any person want to be loved, that is the reason for most of their actions, be it their anger, their fear and many other things.
- Once you make sure they are completely loved, their insecurities fly away and then starts what they want to do in life, what they are interested to do, may be they like painting, they like to do business, whatever it is, then once they get the feel that they are completely loved from their friends and family- an emotional support system. Then whatever they work hard on, they are mostly will be happy in life.
- If say they were not made to feel loved during their growth, or even after that, they continously will be seeking love, to feel secure, in different ways,
    - Some for suppose their father/mother appreciate if study and get good rank, to make them love him, he will working hard studing, by this shitty randomized world if he can, then ok, if this shitty randamized world dosen't allow him to study then he would become miserable, say that person allowed by this world, he got to a good position, now what?, whatever he did till now he did for his dad/mom, now he reached, sometimes after reaching this point his dad/mom still not satisified., sometimes they are satisfied and good, but he don't know what to do with his life, bcs he couldnn't exacly figure out what he actually wanted to do in his life, or what he actually like in his life
- So finally what I wanted to say finally is, just give love to your true relationships, and importantly let them know that you love them, remind them that you love them, make them truly realize that you love them, the important thing is they should feel that you are loving them, there is nothing wrong in it.
- Because that is the only way they can get over their insecurities and truly do what they are passinate about, because there will be times in life where they will feel alone, or abondedned or failures while in the journey of life or in the journey of seeking of what they want in life, at that time they need that emotional support or love from you to tell that you love them no matter what.
- Only then they can overcome their fears and do and achieve whatver they want.
    - Remember this dosen't mean that they do drugs and you support them, NO
    - You tell them, explain them, make them understand the negatives of being bad, this theory is based on the fact that all bad things are bound to make you feel bad after some time, that is while doing say drugs or any bad thing, they may feel good, but because of this soceiety and environment he grew up in, he is bound to feel bad after some time.
    - And similarly once he gets the taste of true happy in doing things he love, in sense of accomplishment, he will get more instrested in it, and only way to get that is by natural principles of hardwork, working sincerely, discipline.

So,

1. Create an environment where he sees good things getting appreciated, and genunelty appreceate him while doing those good things(appreciate the process relatively more than ends)
2. Make him feel that you love him, no matter what,
3. Teach him what's good what's bad.
4. Let him try things till a very far point of unsafe
5. See him overcome his insecurities
6. Also see him realizing true sense of accomplishment in good things
7. That's all
