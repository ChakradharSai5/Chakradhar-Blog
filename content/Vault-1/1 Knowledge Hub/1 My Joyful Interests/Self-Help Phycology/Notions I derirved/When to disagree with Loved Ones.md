# When to disagree with your loved ones?

- Yeah, that's a good question
- My theory is that, you see you have high IQ, no doubt, and many others around you have less IQ, for sure, this means most of the time, you are bound to disagree with many things with a lot people.
    - Its fine if you disagree with people outside your family, you simply stay calm, because who cares?
    - But with the loved ones, especially with Sravya, and cousins or other family members, you will face situation where things sound stupid in that case what you should do?
        - If you think that's something that's going to affect them or us negatively, then once in a while or only once is fine, if it happens regularly or frequently or multiple times then you tell them, until then, you don't support them, don't deny them, just stay calm
        - This is applicable to office subordinates also, or juniors also, that way they know that are doing wrong, but if you correct them at first instance, they will most probably deny or defend it or take you in wrong sense
