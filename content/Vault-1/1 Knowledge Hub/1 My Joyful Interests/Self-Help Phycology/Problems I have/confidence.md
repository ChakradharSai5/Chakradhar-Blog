Therapy problems - I take people at high stature with very high regard, it's very difficult for me to consider them as normal average person, I have to force myself to see that they are also normal like. Else they should make some silly mistake, which is possible when I work with them closely with best example appa Rao saying dhoni to takeout helmet, seems something very much impossible for me to do, because I admire such person so much that I feel may be it is insulting to tell them what to do and not to do
- so in fact because of this, to build confidence for myself, I have a technique- I guess that works only for me- is remember something stupid thing they said or did, only then I feel them as normal so I can treat them normal, else I talk to them in fear- which is something i don't like in myself, as that will demean my self respect
