- Command from DCS from 24V DC goes to relay K11, makes the K11 relay of 110V ac, this in turn makes K10 relay which allows main power of 415V ac 3 Ph through to MOV
- Same goes with K12 relay, K20 relays
- Usually Q20 is for overload current, short circuit current
- And then there is an overload relay
- And then there is Th relay, thermal relay
- As you can see some are NC contact and some NO contact
- For example:
    - RESET shown is usually NC, which becomes NO on thermal overload or current overload
