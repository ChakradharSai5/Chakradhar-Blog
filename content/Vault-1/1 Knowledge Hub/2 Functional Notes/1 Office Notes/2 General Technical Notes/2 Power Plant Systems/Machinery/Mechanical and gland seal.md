Gland seal and sleeve of pump
?
- In old plants we are using mostly gland seal, which requires continous slight water or whatever fluid flow for cooling purpose, other wise, it will cause to burn the gland said in [[Gland seal and sleeve of pump]]
- Now a days this has become obselete, instead we are using mechanical seal which dosen't rquire water falling from it
	- here in [[Stage-1 Details]], CLCW and CEP have gland seal, remaining all have mechanical seal, which means not even a drop of water should drop come from seal
- In new plants most of pumps have gland seal, and in design it will be mentioned how much water should be dropping, like in literes/hour somehtng like that

- impellor is way inside the pump, that is connected at end of shaft
- just connected to left side of impellor (that is bolted is called back plate)

- the thing left to back plate is the actual housing, the mechanical seal is insdie this back plate - stationary

- the small black rectangle between stationary part(silver one ) and back plate is seal gasket

- the rotating part that rotates, has gasket - in big rectangle black, that rotates with shaft, gets pressed to stationary's part black rectangle -which is another gasket, both will be in contact while shaft rotating

- the fluid that is in yellow colour enters from right side point, as it is the gap between rotating and stationary part, comes upto the seal ring, but these seal ring gaskets are made with smooth surface also
	- a thin layer gets formed between these two rotating and sttationary gaskets that will prevent fluid to get out
- In fact, the fluid can be the running fluid of pump, or a fluid externally given for sealing purpose- a path for that is shown in figure above top right entry point for yellow- a circular path
