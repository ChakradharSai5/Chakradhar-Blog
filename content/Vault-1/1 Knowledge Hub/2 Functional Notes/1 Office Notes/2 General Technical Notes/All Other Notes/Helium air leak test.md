### helium leak test
?
- A helium leak test is a method used to detect and locate leaks in sealed systems or components. It involves introducing helium gas into the system and then using a sensitive detector to locate any helium that escapes, indicating a leak. Helium is often chosen as the tracer gas because it is inert, non-toxic, and has very small molecules, making it ideal for detecting tiny leaks.
