- In unit-1 & 2 we have 1234 and 5678 VC fans respectively
- each fan has a pump, called VC pump
- and also each fan/pump has a tank, which has a make up from clarified water
- only one source of makeup
- we have float valve for maintaining level of that tank
- In unit-2 VC-5 & 6 are in 0 meter, which helps cooling for 0mtr, 8.5mtr, 12.5mtr
	- bascially there will big ducts which gets pumped air into it by VC fan so that temperature will not be that hot
	- CV- 7 and 8  are for 27meter switchgear 
- same way with 1 2 3 4 for  Unit-1
