- The generator reading requires a multiplication factor of 4 to get to MWhr, Later find the difference from yesterdays Generator reading to todays and convert it million units,- which must be equal to million units reading taken from DCS.
- Usually every meter reading will be having this multiplication factor, here for generator of unit 1 & 2 multiplication factor is 4 to get in kilo units(1 unit= 1 kilo watt hour), UT-1A/1B,2A/2B have 1(no factor), For all units in Stage-2 2.75
    - so in stage-1 for simplicity we divide by 250 to get in million units
