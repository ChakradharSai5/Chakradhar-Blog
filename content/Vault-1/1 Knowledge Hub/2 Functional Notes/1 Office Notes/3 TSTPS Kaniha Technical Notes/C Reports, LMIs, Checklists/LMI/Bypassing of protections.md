# Categories of permissive and protections.

1. P&I of Boiler, Turbine, Generator and Switchyard
2. P&I of major auxiliary equipment i.e. BFPs, CEPs, HP Heaters, CW Pumps, ID/FD/PA. Fans, Air pre heaters.
3. DC, HT and EH systems and equipment
4. All other auxiliaries including offsite.

# Precautions for protections:

- Inst. Air lo low 3.5ksc
    - If the pressure falls below 3.5 ksc hand trip the boiler.
- Scanner air Pr low < 100 mmWC
    - at local are to br monitored.
    - if both scanner air fan trips then Boiler should be hand tripped .
- TG Electrical OS trip
    - Done during actual OS test when desynchronized
    - Do not allow the actual TG set speed to go beyond 113 % i.e 3390 RPM
- Stator water tank level LO LO i.e < 20 %
    - Actual level to be observed in local
- Stator water flow LO LO i.e < 47.0 m3/hr
    - SW disch pr and DP to be monitored
    - If f both the stator water pumps are tripped, hand trip TG

# P&I of Boiler, Turbine, Generator and Switchyard

- If none of the channels provided in the logic, unit s/d
