## the following battery sets for various D.C. systems are in place in Stage-I.

- Unit Battery 220 V, 1700 AH - Two sets / Unit
- UPS Battery, 415 V, 430 AH - One set/Unit
- 24 V Battery, 860 AH, 24 V - Two sets/Unit is
- DDCMIS Battery 24 V, 1260 AH- Two sets/Unit
- Switchyard Battery set 220 V, 400 AH – Two sets
- PLCC Battery set 50 V, 500 AH - Two sets
- RWPH Battery set 220 V 120 AH - Two sets
- AWRPH Battery set 220 V 120 AH- Two sets
- DG set, 1,2,3 Battery set 24 V.360AH - Two set each
- FWPH Battery set 24 V, 400 AH- Two set for Hydrant system & Two set for Sprinkler System

## NOTE:

**D.C. systems of 220V and 24V are provided with battery sets and chargers. Normally bus sections of DCDB are independently fed from a charger and battery set. In case of problem in any of the battery set / charger, the other set can cater 100 % load.**

## **FAILURE OF 220 V DC (BOTH SECTIONS):**

- Grid condition normal. That is normal A.C. supply is available
    - All HT breakers indication lamps in ECD and LVS will disappear
- **Consequences::**
- Turbine will trip, Trip Solenoid – 220 V DC , normally remain in energized condition
- GCB & FCB will not open and Generator motoring will start.
- Protection will not be available for Generator, Transformer & switchgear.
- § LPBP will not be available. Trip solenoid wills de-energies due to 220 V DC failures. Although console control will be available but due to de-energisation of trip solenoid LPBP operation will not be available.
- Boiler will trip on turbine trip. But if due to some reason boiler fails to trip on turbine tripping, then boiler will trip on activation of RH protection.
- HFO / LDO oil trip valve will close due to 220 V DC failures.
- PA Fans, Mills will continue to be in service.
- SH & RH spray inlet block valves will close ( Energize to open)
- TDBFPs will trip (Trip Solenoid – 220 V DC , normally remain in energized condition ) & their AOPs will continue to run.
- Supply to all emergency DC drives (EOP, DC JOPs, DC SOP, DC Scanner air fan, DC EOP of TDBFPs) will not be available.
- Vacuum breaker ( MOV ) can be operated from UCB console.
- Turbine FC NRVs will be closed
- LVS indication for tap position, winding temp. and synchronization circuit will not be available.
- DG sets cannot be run from local / remote as DC control supply is not available
- APH air motors will be available as its power supply is taken from 240 V AC UPS power supply which is rectified to 24V DC.

Action to be taken: Note: Do not trip the UT-A and UT-B incomer breaker to 11 KV bus UA and UB as this will load to total A.C. failure. Operation group should inform EMD & C&I
