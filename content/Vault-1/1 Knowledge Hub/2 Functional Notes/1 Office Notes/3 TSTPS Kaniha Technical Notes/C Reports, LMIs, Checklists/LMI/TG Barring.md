- Barring gear arrangement is provided to keep it rotating at a nominal speed for preventing thermal bending (Eccentricity) in hot conditions to allow uniform heating or cooling during start up or shut down and thus prevent developing rotor eccentricity.
- In case of machines provided with motorized baring gear, the barring stalling usually does not take place, but increase in motor current takes place depending upon severity and resistance to rotation. Under such conditions, the chances of damage are increased

# **FACTORS AFECTING BARRING STALLING**

- . **Adequate lift by jacking oil at bearings 3,4,5**
- Adequate Radial and Axial clearances between Turbine shaft and Stationery components
- . Quality of Seal steam, at rated temperature and pressure without any moisture/condensate. . Quality of Seal steam, at rated temperature and pressure without any moisture/condensate.
- Lubrication of oil

# • **TURNING GEAR INTERLOCKS:**

- Motor will take start at Turbine Speed <20 rpm
- pinion engages with the turbine gear wheel.
- When Rolled with steam,, Turning gear Motor stops at speed >20 rpm

# **TURNING GEAR WILL TRIP UNDER FOLLOWING CONDITIONS**

- TG protection Cap open above baring motor.
- H2 seal oil DP low (<0.1bar) 2/3 logic.
- Both AOP off d) Lube oil pressure after filter less than 0.8 ksc.
- Turning gear motor ON and speed less than 3RPH

# **WHEN MACHINE IS ON LOAD:**

- Ensure proper Glandseal steam
- Jacking oil system healthy
- Hand barring handle & key
- Lub oil system throughness

# **WHEN MACHINE COASTING DOWN:**

- record Turbine vibration
- availability of Key and hand baring handle
- AC AOP starts at 2800rpm
- LP gland seal steam temperature should be maintained at 170 deg C. gland steam should not be charged with Aux PRDS steam, till HP shaft temperature reaches 280 deg C.
- Seal steam header pressure to be Maintain positive (otherwise atmospheric air will rush in and cause chilling of glands causing barring seizure) and controller is to be maintained on auto.
- Extraction block vales gets closed, all Turbine drains and extraction line drains are open.
- Monitor:
    - HP inner casing temperature, outer casing temperature
    - IP casing top/bottom temperature-Front and Rear -
    - LPT exhaust hood temperature

## During shut down after 60mins of trip:

- . isolating valves of CRH line drains (upstream and downstream of NRV) are open.
- HPBP spray isolation valves are closed and All FC NRV are closed and FC NRV drain pot, drain valves are functioning as per logic and CRH line drain valves are open.
- Take a walk down survey within 60-90 minutes of unit trip,

## AFter shutdown

- Subsequent to CW stoppage, if any Deaerator draining is required and feed water is hot, it is required to be drained through drain connected to Boiler flash tank.
- Keep at least 1 CW pump running for at least 48hrs
- If Unit is to remain out for more than 4 to 6 hours, Vacuum should preferably be killed. To prevent air chilling of glands,
- Normally Vacuum killing is started after Boiler depressurization
- Isolate gland steam.
- Stop Vacuum pump
- Kill Vacuum by opening Vacuum breaker at 200mmgh vacuum.
- · Keep Isolate auxiliary Gland seal steam to Turbine. Keep Aux PRDS drain at 17mtr TG side in crack open condition.
- Ensure opening of CRH to Gland steam line drains, to prevent any accidental moisture entry to gland steam.

## **If Turbine speed slow down is observed;**

- If auxiliary seal steam is charged, check that seal steam temperature is at least 2800C1and Seal steam header pressure is normal
- If difficulty is faced in achieving required temperature, then in order to avoid condensation/chilling due to low temperature, sufficient flow of auxiliary seal steam can be ensured by opening both i.e. seal steam supply control valve and leak off control valve
    - This will help in maximizing seal steam flow while maintaining seal steam header pressure
- If condenser is under vacuum and seal steam temperature is not under control, then kill the condenser vacuum and isolate seal steam supply.

## **If TG comes stand still**

- Then hand barring should be done immediately. Rotate half a turn (1800 )every 10 minutes
- If Barring gear is not able to rotate by one person, then no extra force on rotor should be applied and it should be allowed to cool, till the time it becomes free.
    - HP turbine control valves should never be opened which can cause speed to rise by steam force
    - In this condition if any extra force is applied, it will damage the seals (bending, wearing, dislodging) and adversely
    - affect the turbine clearances, efficiency and reliability. Keep on trying with one person, every 15 minutes.
- · In case of failure of lube oil system or jacking oil system, if rotor have come to rest, no attempt should be made to turn the shaft either by hand or power until oil supplies are restored
- after ensuring turbine is free to rotate by hand baring, then put t turbine is to be put on aux turning gear, if , with no abnormal sound and no sign of abnormal vibration, n, then Power baring to be started.

## **If during barring**

- there is a abnormal sound OR
- Baring motor current hunting or increase in baring motor curre OR
- increasing vibration shaft/bearing vibration trend OR
    - Then barring gear should be stopped and hand barring should be done with half a revolution every 10 minutes
- Actions During Grid/Total AC failure:
    - starting of DC EOP and DC JOP,
    - JOP pressure at bearing 3,4,5 are above alarm values[above 70ksc]
    - isolating valves of HPBP spray, Superheat spray, Reheat spray station to be closed immediately
    - Gland steam condenser exhauster to be re-started ensuring seal steam is in charged condition
    - Do not apply any type of steam on standstill turbine.

## **During start up**

- Aux steam to gland steam Motorised isolating valve, it should be ensured that Aux steam header drain at 17mtr is open, and Aux PRDS to gland steam line motorized drain valve is open and steam temperature at 8.5 mtr is sufficient.
- If HP shaft temperature is above 3000C then before seal steam charging, ensure that Seal steam temperature is above 2850C,
- When HP shaft temperature is below 3000C, then ensure that seal steam temperature is about 230-2400C
- Drains of LPBP line and HP/IP Stop/Control valve and drain valve are open
    - otherwise seal steam header temperature may fall due to entry of moist steam into the seal steam leak off header
- At the time of HP bypass charging it should be ensured that CRH NRV remains fully close

## • **IN HAND BARRING:**

If excessive force is found necessary, the rotor should be left stationary, condenser vacuum to be killed immediately and rotor allowed to cool. Check for the freeness of the rotor every 15 minutes. After cooling, when the rotor becomes free, resume hand barring slowly following the frequency of half a revolution every 10 minutes. Power barring can be used when the rotor becomes completely free. first, check aux turning gear. and then power baring to be started

- In case of failure of Generator seal oil supplies and if it is essential to turn the rotors, only hand barring should be tried
- If main Turning Gear is not coming in service due to problem in motor then Auxiliary turning gear is to be taken up in service on continuous basis till the HP turbine shaft reference temp. comes down to 150 0 C . The aux. TG not to be tried for a locked rotor case
