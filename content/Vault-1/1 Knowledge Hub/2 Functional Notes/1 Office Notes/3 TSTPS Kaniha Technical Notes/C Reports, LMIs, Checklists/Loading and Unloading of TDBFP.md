### **Loading and unloading BFP at full load:**

- In full load I took TD-1a, while TD-1b & md-c are in service.
- and loaded td-1a, and unloaded md-c and stopped the pump
    - 1. roll td-1a, as already impulse chamber temp is achieved. (If charged very long ago, impulse chamber will be attained well before)
    - 2. directly go beyond 3000rpm, as the suction flow opens beyond 300Tph, exhaust temp found decreasing, till that exhaust temp was maintaining high
    - 3. already individual disch pr of bfps maintaining around 200ksc, and so till around 190ksc of this td-1a loading, i did with big pulses of command.
    - 4. Later i gave small pulses, so that slowly bfp discharge pr gets matched and when td-a gets loaded, correspndingly td-b and md-c slowly gets unloaded
    - 5. when the run permissive came and speeds of td-a and td-b are almost macthicng, td-a also kept in auto
    - 6. later md-c taken r/c slowly opened while td-a suction being closed slowly , after doing that, md-c scoop taken in manual and slowly decrased up until the point it gets unloaded
    - 7. once unloaded thatis pr gets decreased blw disch hdr pr, decreased fastly and so at around 90ksc disch pr. md-c stopped
