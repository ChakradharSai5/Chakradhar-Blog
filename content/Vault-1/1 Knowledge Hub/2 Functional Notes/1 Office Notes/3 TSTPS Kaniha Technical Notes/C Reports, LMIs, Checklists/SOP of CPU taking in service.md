### This is rough SOP of what I saw
- A common line used for resin transfer for both taking from CPU to DM plant and the other way
- just at the CPU two lines taken from this used one connected to bottom of CPU for taking from CPU, other connected to middle top to send resin to CPU


Now for taking CPU in service
- resin gets transfeered from DM plant to CPU using middle top line valve
- then that's closed, and inlet manual valve crack opened, and inlet pnumeatic valve's IBV opened, and vent of CPU kept crack open, seen that CPU got filled with water coming from vent, vent is closed
- outlet valve crack opened -*doubt* #pending , drain at outlet made fully open, left for flushing, for some time as seen in local, a conductivity point taken at outlet of CPU is seen, when it comes around 0.2, drain made closed and outlet and inlet made fully open
