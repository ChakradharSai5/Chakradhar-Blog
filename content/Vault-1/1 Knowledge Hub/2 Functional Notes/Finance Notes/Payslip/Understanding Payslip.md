There are basically two parts to this
1. **Our NTPC side**, which includes calculating "Total Earnings" and "Total Deductions", & by substracting latter from former, we'll get "Net Pay".
    A. Note that "Net Pay" is our in hand Salary
2. **Form 16 Side(Income Tax to Govt. of India Side),** This is basically calculated to find our that month income tax deduction amount.
    B. Note that this calculation is what that gives "Income Tax" value used in "Total Deductions".     

### Approach:
So approach would be like this Steps
Step1. 
	is to get all Taxable income, for that  
    Under tab "Total Earnings", get incomes that taxable, here in our case
            A. Basic
            B. DA
            C. Cafeteria Allowances(35%)
            D. Local Travel Re-Fix (Vehicle Maint.) are included, 
			E. [[NPS]] contribution(8.99% of Basic+DA) also to be added, mentioned below "Net Pay"
		And Petrol, Night shift & CPC(whatever it is), are excluded 
Step2. 
	This shall be equal to "Gross Taxable Income Till Date" if it is April Month, if not, this "A+B+C+D+E" added to "Gross Taxable Income Till Date" of previous month, shall be equal to "Gross Taxable Income Till Date" of this month.


Step3. 
	Next "Projected Gross Income" is equal to "A+B+C+D+E" times Number of months remaining in this financial year


Step4.
	"Perk:Value Housing", "Loan Int. Rate Adv Taxed", "Yearly conveyence perk" & "Gross Taxable Income Till Date" & "Projected Gross Income" are all added. this sum say P.


Step5. 
	P-Deductions/Exemptions, i.e P-"Standard Deduction", shall give "Gross Total Income"


Step6. 
	Agg. of Chapter IV, which is now(under New Tax Regime), just [[NPS]], so  "NPS contributed by NTPC" times 12 which say Q.


Step7.
	Now "Gross Total Income"-Q shall give "Total Income"

Step8. 
	"Tax on Total Income" calculated based on slab (New Tax Regime), & "Tax payable and Surcharge" calculation also done, by adding surcharge

Step9.
	"Tax deducted so far" is self explanotory - just sum of "Income Tax" under tab "Deductions" of all previous months of financial year.

Step10. 
	"Net Tax payable" calculation is self explanotary, "Income Tax" is calculated by dividing it by 12.

Step11. 
	Now finally, for our "Net Pay", simply, "Total Earnings" - "Total Deductions"(which include "Income Tax" we calculated),

Step12. 
	That "Net Pay", is our in hand.
