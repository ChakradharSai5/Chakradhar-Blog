    - sitting hours together for a long time, causes
        - disc gets thinner
        - fluid inside disc comes out
        - disc gets weaker
    - SO to avoid that , stand dup every hour and drink some water, do some stretches
    - Sitting 3hrs continuity disk gets thinner, fluid comes out, so
        - Get up every hour and drink water and walk
