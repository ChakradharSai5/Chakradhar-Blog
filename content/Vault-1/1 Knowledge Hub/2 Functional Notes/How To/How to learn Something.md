        - You'll notice the parts that are not clear
    - Go back and study about it again

        - UNITL SATISFIED WITH SIMPLE CLEAR EXPLANATION
- Revise it frequently with recalling, recall and revise, don't just read it again, recall it as much as possible and then look at the topic and see what you missed, this way your mind goes through the topic in logical connected way.
