- Abhishek padhi sir
    - He and madhukar, used data different factor like humidity, temperature, may be seasonality etc and made a model that predicts how much solar generation happens and presented a paper at O&M conference
    - Padhi sir made regresssion model that helps in modeling bunker level from the graph that we have, it is like, for that we have to give input, square, linear etc and we use 75% of the data for making model and 25% used for checking that model is properly working or not, how far our model prediction matches with actual 25% data we have, we can see the graph, where it shows the model and 25% data and we can see the matching percentage from it. And we give different inputs square, linear, may be some constants to see how best it is matching with model and so from that we can exactly find the model we want
