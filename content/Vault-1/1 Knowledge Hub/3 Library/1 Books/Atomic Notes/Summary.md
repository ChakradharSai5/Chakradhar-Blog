## Chapter-1 The fundamentals

### Page-1

- The aggregation of marginal gains
    - British cyclists **marginal** improvement in all possible areas
    - Span of 5 years , won many medals- succeeded
- They seem to to make little differnce on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years canbe enormous. It is only when looking back two, five or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly appranet
- Success is a product of daily habits -- not once in a lifetime transformations
- You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results
- **Forget about goals, focus on the systems instead,** because these are the problmes if you follow only goals:
    - Winners and losers have same goals
        - Every Olympian wants to win a medal,
        - Difference will be the system
    - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
        - Ok, assume you reached your goal, what do you do after, next day?, so design a system that keeps you content and happy
        - You clean up say your room, it gets mess up again, so place a system to keep it clean always
    - Goal restrict your happiness
        - "Once I reach my goal, I'll be happy", the problem with this is you'll be continously putting off your happiness off until next milestone
        - Also goal creates either-or situation, either you do , or you fail, while in actual your path through life will match with the exact journy you had in mind when you set out.
        - Makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success
        - When you fall in love with process than the product, you don't hve to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.
        - And a system can be successful in many different forms, not the one you first envison
    - Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
        - Don't be like, as soon as you cross the line you stop training
        - When your hardwork is focused ona particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?
        - The purpose of system is to continue playing the game.
        - Itâ€™s about the cycle of endless refinement and continous imporvoment

- **What progress really looks like?**
    - Its not linear, its exponential, so the initial growth will be slow
- **A system of atomic habits**
    - These tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment.
    - **REMEMEBER THAT YOUR SYSTEM IS YOUR SECUE PLACE.**
    - **YOU WILL FEEL SECURE AND CONFIDENT WHEN YOUR SYSTEM IS WORKING FINE.**
