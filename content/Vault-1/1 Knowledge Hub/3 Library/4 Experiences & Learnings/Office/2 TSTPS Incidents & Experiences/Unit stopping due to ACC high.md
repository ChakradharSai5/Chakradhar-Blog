Unit-1 stopped as ACC went very high, out of range- #pending ,in all circuits that are condensate, feedwater SH and RH circuits. 
ACC means After cation conductivity
Initially we thought it might be because of condenser tube leakage, but later it is found that resin trap of CPU found heavy passing, and so the resin of CPU went into the system, and it went upto turbine,
- As per TMD, once the resin enters SH  or RH circuit due to high pressure and temperature it gets disintegrates and it wont be in form of particles it might be but very small
- later TDBFP and MDBFP *vertical* strainers found to have choked with resin matter
--- 
- So later after replacing that resin trap of CPU by TMD, as we need to do flushing of all water of all circuits
						- condensate
						- feedwater
						- boiler water wall
						- separator
						- SH circuit
						- RH circuit
- so what we did is first kept in only condensate circuit in circulation for a long time, with condensate dumping, and taking makeup only from DM plant, not from CST, later taken from CST only after clearance from chemistry that water is good in CST
- after chemistry clearance to charge feedwater, did that and again, kept in circulation with draining/dumping from De aerator to BFT, same goes here
- like that again after clearance from chem. boiler filling done up to separator and draining/dumping from separator.
-**at every stage of charging new circuit chemistry clearance is taken**
- after clearance for charging SH circuit, as we know water cannot be given to SH circuit, so what we did is, did light up done, charged SH circuit with steam MS pressure >1ksc, but as in stage-1 we put HPBP open (as per OEM) at even at MS pressure 0ksc, (startup mode), so kept HPBP open, and LPBP close, charged CRH and so HRH also, but kept the RH pressure at less than 2ksc, as LPBP gets open (as per OEM startup procedure ) at 2ksc, and all atmosphere connected drains  made completely open and drains of TFT  made close and kept like that for many hours
- to avoid [[Starvation]] we had to keep the RH pressure under 2ksc, as per procedure, this is at what pressure that the LPBP gets open slowly , so as per design , drains of RH can cater upto 2ksc, later as it cannot cater, we have to open the LPBP.
- only later after clearance from chemistry, we did charge LPBP
- then rolling as per procedure


**so just ACC maintaining high is quite important at any circuit**
