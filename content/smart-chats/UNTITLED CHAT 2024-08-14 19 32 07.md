Based on your notes, creating your blog, \"Chakradhar-Blog Making,\" involved a series of challenges you had to overcome.
You faced difficulties integrating your blog with your existing phone and tablet synchronization system, leading to the creation of two separate folders for Obsidian and the blog. You also had to find a software to synchronize these folders efficiently.
Another challenge involved displaying Excalidraw drawings in your blog, requiring you to find a way to automatically generate SVG files alongside Excalidraw drawings.
Embedding files, particularly PDFs and images, presented further hurdles. You experimented with various solutions, including Imgur, Google Photos, and iframe code, before settling on storing images and PDFs directly on GitHub.
Finally, restructuring your Obsidian notes to accommodate these changes was a time-consuming and challenging task.
